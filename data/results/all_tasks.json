Parents report that since early childhood he has appeared “clumsy,” with frequent tripping, difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning clothes and handwriting, and an unsteady, wide-based gait. Teachers have noted problems with tasks requiring precise hand–eye coordination, and he fatigues more quickly than peers during physical activity. There is no history of regression, seizures, or acute encephalopathic events, but parents describe intermittent episodes of low energy and vague muscle discomfort after prolonged exertion, raising concern for a possible inborn error of metabolism affecting energy utilization. Family history is notable for a paternal uncle with lifelong poor coordination and tremulous handwriting, never formally evaluated, and a maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. No known consanguinity is reported. David is referred today for neurologic and metabolic evaluation to clarify the etiology of his ataxic symptoms and to guide further diagnostic testing and management.\n",

Since infancy, she has demonstrated poor overall growth and failure to thrive despite appropriate nutritional support. Birth and early childhood records describe multiple congenital anomalies, including a cleft in the upper esophagus consistent with an esophageal atresia variant, as well as a congenital malformation of the right external ear with abnormal auricular shape and positioning. Cardiac evaluation in infancy identified a structural abnormality of the pulmonary valve, with ongoing cardiology follow-up. Physical examination has been notable for a pattern of minor facial differences and body proportion abnormalities suggestive of an underlying congenital malformation syndrome. A chromosomal microarray performed on 07/02/2025 was reported as negative, without pathogenic copy number changes to explain her presentation. She is followed by developmental pediatrics and multiple subspecialists, and is referred today for further genetic evaluation to clarify an underlying syndromic diagnosis and guide prognosis and management.\n",

Since early childhood, caregivers have noted distinctive facial and craniofacial features, including a broad forehead and subtle midface differences, along with external ear anomalies characterized by unusually shaped pinnae. Clinical concerns also include a congenital renal cystic abnormality, with imaging documenting multiple renal cysts and ongoing nephrology follow-up to monitor kidney function and blood pressure. Growth parameters have been variably affected, and there is suspicion of an underlying congenital malformation syndrome involving multiple organ systems. Family history is notable for a paternal uncle with early-onset colon cancer in his 40s and a maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hypertension; no known relatives have similar developmental or craniofacial features. Prior genetic evaluation included a multigene panel performed on 2025-06-08, which did not identify a pathogenic variant and was reported as negative.\n",

History is notable for bilateral ear malformations with low-set, cupped auricles and mild conductive hearing concerns, as well as a congenital malformation of the pulmonary valve, followed by cardiology for a stable obstructive lesion without current heart failure symptoms. Renal imaging has shown a unilateral cystic kidney consistent with a dysplastic process; blood pressure and renal function are monitored and currently stable. Physical exam has previously documented features suggestive of a congenital pattern of skeletal and craniofacial differences, including short stature trend and subtle facial dysmorphism. A chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-08-30 was reported negative for pathogenic copy number changes.

Birth and early childhood records describe structural abnormalities of the cerebral hemispheres on neuroimaging, associated with a syndromic pattern of growth and minor anomalies suggestive of an underlying genetic syndrome. Cardiac history is notable for a small atrial-level septal defect identified in early childhood, reported as hemodynamically mild and monitored conservatively. Dysmorphic features have been described on prior exams, including subtle craniofacial differences consistent with a syndromic diagnosis. Past injuries include a prior forehead laceration and a documented mild closed head injury without loss of consciousness, as well as a superficial facial burn, all of which have healed without reported long-term sequelae.

Orthopedic history includes congenital foot malalignment with persistent deformity of the right ankle and hindfoot, for which she has required bracing and intermittent physical therapy. Renal imaging performed in early childhood revealed structural abnormality of the kidney consistent with a cystic dysplastic process, monitored by nephrology. Past medical history is also significant for a prior minor head injury without loss of consciousness and an allergic-type adverse reaction to penicillin-class antibiotics, presenting with rash and gastrointestinal upset.

Since infancy, she has had prominent malformations of the external ears with abnormal positioning and structure, accompanied by a small head size noted on early well-child examinations and confirmed on serial growth measurements. Parents report delayed attainment of gross motor and language milestones; she required early intervention services for walking and continues to receive school-based support for learning difficulties and borderline intellectual functioning. Clinical concerns include poor overall growth and short stature, with height and weight persistently below age-appropriate percentiles despite adequate nutrition. Physical examination has previously documented a pattern of multiple congenital anomalies with distinctive facial features suggestive of an underlying syndromic etiology. There is no reported history of seizures or regression. Prior genetic evaluation included a targeted gene panel performed on 2025-12-19, which was reported as negative and non-diagnostic. Further comprehensive genetic testing is being considered to better characterize the underlying condition and guide anticipatory management and counseling.\n",
