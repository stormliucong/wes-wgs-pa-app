    "other_details": "Tristan Irwin is a 14-year-old male seen following a recent head injury consistent with a concussion without loss of consciousness. History describes an acute event with subsequent concussion-type symptoms impacting daily function, including headache and a sense of mental “fog,” with reduced tolerance for screen time and schoolwork since the injury; there has been no reported blackout at the time of impact. He also has a superficial burn involving the head and neck region, described as an unspecified-degree burn affecting the skin of this area. The burn has been associated with localized pain and tenderness, with visible erythema over the involved scalp/neck region and sensitivity to touch; no additional burn sites are described. The combined injuries have led to short-term limitations in usual activities, particularly tasks requiring sustained concentration and comfort with head/neck movement. No family history or prior genetic/metabolic testing information is available in the record for this encounter, and no prior test dates or results are provided.",
