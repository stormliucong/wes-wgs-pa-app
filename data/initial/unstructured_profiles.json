He also carries a history of acidosis with recurrent low serum bicarbonate on prior chemistry panels, consistent with a metabolic acidosis pattern; recent representative labs show CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on multiple checks with an anion gap around 10–12, and venous blood gas pH 7.30–7.33, indicating a persistent rather than isolated abnormality. Episodes are reported to be more noticeable during intercurrent illness with worsened fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, but baseline low bicarbonate has also been documented. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with long-standing problems with balance and coordination described as “ataxia,” and a paternal cousin with recurrent metabolic acidosis requiring hospital evaluation in childhood; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Records describe persistent hyperphenylalaninemia on monitoring, with plasma phenylalanine typically in the 900–1200 µmol/L range on several checks over the past year (most recently 1050 µmol/L), with comparatively normal tyrosine around 55–75 µmol/L, consistent with ongoing elevation rather than a single episodic spike. Clinically, he has had intermittent seizure-like events characterized by sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking, lasting approximately 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for 20–30 minutes; episodes have occurred a few times per year and have resulted in missed school days after events. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a childhood-onset seizure disorder and a maternal cousin reported to have elevated phenylalanine on newborn screening requiring ongoing dietary management."

Parents report these coordination problems are persistent rather than episodic and interfere with age-appropriate play. Laboratory history is notable for other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry; available records show persistently elevated serum lactate in the 3.0–3.8 mmol/L range (ref 0.5–2.2) on repeat measurements over several months, with intermittent mild elevation of plasma ammonia to 70–85 µmol/L (ref <50). These biochemical findings have been documented on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated result. Family history is significant for consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A paternal uncle is reported to have longstanding gait unsteadiness and poor coordination since childhood, and a maternal cousin has a history of recurrent abnormal blood chemistry testing described by the family as “high lactate,” without additional documented details."

Events have been described as sudden spells of unresponsiveness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for up to an hour; frequency has been intermittent with clusters during intercurrent illness and after missed meals, impacting school attendance and sports participation. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently elevated plasma lactate (3.8–4.6 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (28–32), and episodic mild metabolic acidosis during febrile illnesses (bicarbonate 17–19 mmol/L). Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A maternal uncle reportedly had childhood-onset seizures, and a paternal cousin has a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic disorder with exercise intolerance. No prior genetic test results were available for review in the record provided.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent right ankle sprain with pain and swelling after an inversion injury, and a concussion without loss of consciousness following a head impact, with transient headache and dizziness that resolved over several days."

History is notable for an open wound of the scalp with active bleeding at the time of presentation, described as a laceration without mention of intracranial involvement; the family reports it occurred suddenly and required prompt wound care due to persistent oozing and tenderness at the site. She also has an acute burn involving the head/face/neck region, described as a burn of unspecified degree, with localized pain and erythema; the affected area is sensitive to touch and has interfered with normal sleep and routine activities. In addition, there is concern for accidental penicillin exposure with features consistent with poisoning by penicillins, described as an unintentional ingestion; caregivers report the event was abrupt and prompted urgent evaluation for potential medication toxicity.

Records describe persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine on metabolic monitoring, with representative values around 680–820 µmol/L on several checks, while tyrosine has remained within reference range; elevations are described as chronic rather than episodic and have been tracked longitudinally. Early history includes decreased neonatal tone with “floppy” appearance and reduced spontaneous movement noted in the newborn period; caregivers reported weak antigravity limb activity and poor head control early on, with gradual improvement over time. There is a relevant family history of similar phenylalanine metabolism disorder in an older sibling and a paternal cousin, both described as requiring ongoing biochemical monitoring. The parents are first cousins, which is documented in the family pedigree. No additional syndromic features are described beyond the above, and the clinical narrative remains focused on the metabolic phenotype and the early hypotonia noted in infancy."

He has had intermittent nutritional monitoring, and recent labs obtained during symptomatic periods showed a positive stool reducing substances test and low stool pH (5.0), with otherwise stable basic metabolic parameters; the pattern has been persistent rather than episodic. Neurologic history is notable for ataxia manifested as unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, with difficulty running and frequent tripping compared with peers; fine motor tasks such as handwriting and utensil use are described as clumsy, with fluctuating severity but ongoing functional impact at school and during sports.

    "clinical_note": "Anthony Davis is a 3-year-old male with history notable for episodic seizures of unclear type, described by caregivers as sudden stiffening with rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes and followed by several hours of sleepiness; events have occurred intermittently since infancy and have led to urgent evaluations. He also carries a history of acidosis, with prior laboratory documentation of low serum bicarbonate (typically 14–16 mmol/L) and an elevated anion gap (about 18–22), noted on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated finding. Caregivers report these acidotic episodes are most apparent during intercurrent illnesses with decreased oral intake, when he becomes more fatigued and tachypneic, prompting repeat blood testing. Family history is significant for consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A paternal uncle is reported to have had recurrent seizures beginning in childhood, and a maternal cousin has a history of episodic “blood acid” problems requiring hospital care, without further diagnostic details available in the record."

Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, most recently 780 µmol/L (reference 30–120) with tyrosine at the low end of normal at 35 µmol/L (reference 30–120), with prior values typically ranging 600–900 µmol/L during periods of dietary liberalization. Caregivers describe sensitivity of levels to protein intake, with episodic rises noted after higher-protein meals. Neurologically, he has recurrent generalized seizures that remain difficult to control, occurring several times per month with postictal sleepiness and missed school days; there has been no history of convulsive status epilepticus.

Neurologic history is notable for episodes of seizures without a specified type; events have been intermittent, with sudden onset of altered responsiveness and generalized shaking reported by family, followed by post-event sleepiness, and these episodes have interfered with school attendance on days they occur. Metabolic evaluation has shown low lactase activity consistent with congenital lactase deficiency, and nutritional monitoring has included periodic stool testing demonstrating persistently acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances during symptomatic periods after lactose exposure. Family history is significant for similar dairy intolerance in the father and recurrent seizure episodes in a paternal uncle. The parents are first cousins."

Cardiac history includes a secundum atrial septal defect identified in childhood, followed clinically without additional detail available in this record. Neurodevelopmental history is significant for a specific developmental disorder of motor function, with longstanding fine- and gross-motor coordination difficulties that affect handwriting, dressing skills, and participation in age-appropriate sports, without characterization here as a broader cognitive disorder. He has multiple congenital anomalies consistent with the above syndrome and associated findings. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2025-10-18, reported as negative."

She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with reproducible gastrointestinal intolerance to lactose-containing foods. Caregivers report that even small amounts of milk or ice cream trigger watery diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain within a few hours, with improvement when lactose is strictly avoided. Prior metabolic evaluation has documented low small-bowel lactase activity (0.5 U/g; reference ≥10 U/g) and repeated low lactose tolerance testing with minimal rise in serum glucose after lactose load (increase 8 mg/dL), consistent with a persistent enzymatic deficiency rather than intermittent intolerance. Family history is significant for an older brother with similar lifelong lactose-triggered diarrhea requiring strict dietary avoidance, and a maternal aunt reported to have had low muscle tone in infancy requiring physical therapy. Parents deny consanguinity."

    "clinical_note": "Jennifer Wright is a 6-year-old female with history notable for congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong intolerance to lactose-containing foods. Since infancy, exposure to breast milk/formula or later dairy products has reliably triggered profuse watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, and irritability, with improvement on strict lactose avoidance; even small amounts of hidden lactose (e.g., in processed foods) can provoke symptoms within hours. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent carbohydrate malabsorption consistent with lactase deficiency, including repeated stool testing with acidic pH around 5.0 and positive reducing substances (1–2+), and breath hydrogen testing demonstrating a marked rise after lactose challenge (baseline 8 ppm to 62 ppm at 90 minutes). Neurologic history includes ataxia manifested by an unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, with frequent tripping and difficulty with tandem walking and stairs, affecting playground activities; symptoms are described as chronic rather than episodic. Family history is notable for lactose intolerance in the father and a paternal aunt with longstanding dairy-triggered diarrhea; parents deny consanguinity."

    "clinical_note": "Barbara Phillips is a 6-year-old female with history notable for a disorder of aromatic amino-acid metabolism with episodic biochemical decompensation and associated motor incoordination. During intercurrent illness and periods of reduced intake, caregivers report worsening unsteady gait and clumsiness with frequent stumbling and difficulty with tandem walking, consistent with ataxia that interferes with play and school activities. Between episodes, coordination improves but she remains more accident-prone than peers. Prior metabolic monitoring has shown elevated plasma phenylalanine, including a recent value of 980 µmol/L during a symptomatic period with partial improvement to 420 µmol/L on repeat testing when clinically stable, supporting a persistent tendency toward hyperphenylalaninemia with episodic worsening. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle described as having a similar amino-acid metabolism disorder requiring lifelong dietary management, and a maternal cousin with childhood-onset gait unsteadiness. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives from the same extended lineage with comparable metabolic concerns."

Neurologic exam has been characterized by gait ataxia with impaired balance on turning and inconsistent heel-to-shin performance, without describing a separate movement disorder diagnosis. Metabolic evaluation has supported a mitochondrial metabolism disorder with episodic elevations in serum lactate, including a documented lactate of 3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) during intercurrent illness and a repeat fasting lactate of 2.6 mmol/L on a well day, suggesting a persistent tendency toward mild hyperlactatemia with worsening during physiologic stress.

Motor development has been impacted by persistent fine- and gross-motor incoordination, including clumsiness and difficulty with tasks requiring bilateral coordination and motor planning, affecting handwriting, dressing, and participation in age-appropriate sports. Neurodevelopmental history is also significant for a congenital malformation syndrome with dysmorphic features; on exam he has mild facial asymmetry and low-set ears. He carries a diagnosis consistent with a defined congenital malformation syndrome rather than an isolated anomaly, and his multisystem history has been followed in that context. There is no additional symptom complex described beyond what is captured by his known cardiac and brain malformations and coordination disorder. Prior genetic evaluation included a gene panel performed on 2025-09-29, which was reported as negative."

Since early childhood, she has had an unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent tripping, difficulty with tandem walking, and clumsiness with tasks requiring rapid alternating movements; symptoms fluctuate with exertion and intercurrent illness and have interfered with sports participation and handwriting endurance at school. Metabolic monitoring has shown episodic lactic acid elevations consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including venous lactate 4.8 mmol/L during a viral illness and a repeat baseline lactate 2.6 mmol/L on a well day, with an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 28; serum CK has been mildly increased at 320 U/L on one occasion. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a similar lifelong unsteady gait and exercise intolerance, and a maternal grandmother reported to have episodic fatigue with prolonged exertion; there is no reported consanguinity."

Examination is notable for mild dysmorphic features, including a long philtrum and low-set ears. She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with gastrointestinal symptoms beginning in early childhood; caregivers report reproducible watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating after ingestion of milk or standard dairy products, with improvement when lactose is avoided. Prior records include metabolic support consistent with lactase deficiency, including a lactose challenge associated with a rise in breath hydrogen to 45 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes and acidic stool (pH 5.0) during symptomatic episodes, suggesting persistent lactose sensitivity rather than episodic intolerance. Family history is significant for a paternal aunt with longstanding dairy-triggered diarrhea consistent with lactase deficiency and a younger brother with hypotonia noted in infancy; parents deny consanguinity. Chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-08-20 was negative."

He also carries a history of acidosis; available laboratory data show persistently low serum bicarbonate around 16–18 mmol/L with a mildly elevated anion gap (approximately 18–20) on repeat checks, with episodes of worsening fatigue and tachypnea during intercurrent illness when bicarbonate has fallen to ~14 mmol/L. Dysmorphic features include a long narrow face and low-set ears on exam. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity; the parents are first cousins. A paternal aunt reportedly has a seizure disorder beginning in adolescence, and a maternal cousin has a history of recurrent “acidotic” hospitalizations in childhood per family report.

Dysmorphic findings include a congenital eyelid anomaly described as ectropion, with outward turning of the lid margin noted since infancy, and a congenital foot deformity characterized as talipes equinovarus affecting the feet. Motor development has been impacted by a specific developmental disorder of motor function, with longstanding difficulty in coordination and motor planning that has interfered with age-appropriate gross and fine motor tasks (e.g., running, stair negotiation, handwriting, and self-care skills), requiring extra time and support for daily activities. Physical phenotype and functional history are reviewed in the context of the above congenital anomalies without attributing causality among co-existing findings. Prior genetic testing is documented: chromosomal microarray (CMA) performed on 2025-12-21 was negative."

Since early toddlerhood, caregivers describe an unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent stumbles, difficulty navigating stairs without support, and impaired balance that is more apparent with fatigue and during intercurrent illnesses; there is no report of a focal weakness pattern, but coordination limits age-appropriate running and playground activities. Metabolic evaluation has shown recurrent elevations of serum lactate, with values ranging 3.8–5.6 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) on multiple draws, including during baseline health, along with intermittently increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (up to 28), supporting an ongoing mitochondrial metabolic disturbance rather than a single episodic finding. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. A maternal uncle is reported to have a similar longstanding unsteady gait beginning in childhood, and a paternal cousin has a documented mitochondrial metabolism disorder with episodic fatigue and exercise intolerance."

Episodes are described as sudden loss of awareness with whole-body stiffening and rhythmic jerking, followed by postictal sleepiness and headache, occurring several times per month despite adherence to prescribed antiseizure therapy. Between events, caregivers report variable fatigue and reduced stamina on school days after seizures. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent acidosis consistent with a chronic tendency toward low serum bicarbonate; recent labs have included CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on repeat measurements with a mildly elevated anion gap (18–20), without clear episodic resolution, and these findings have been followed over time in the context of her neurologic history.

    "clinical_note": "Donna Hall is a 7-year-old female with history notable for phenylketonuria and epilepsy characterized by other generalized seizures without status epilepticus. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine despite dietary sensitivity, with recent values around 780 µmol/L (reference 30–120) and prior measurements typically ranging 600–900 µmol/L, while plasma tyrosine has been low-normal at approximately 35 µmol/L (reference 40–90). Caregivers describe that higher phenylalanine levels tend to coincide with increased irritability and reduced attention at school, though no acute metabolic decompensation episodes are reported. Seizure history is described as generalized events with abrupt loss of awareness and bilateral stiffening followed by rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes, occurring about 1–2 times per month, with postictal sleepiness for up to an hour; no episodes have progressed to status epilepticus. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset generalized epilepsy and a paternal cousin diagnosed with phenylketonuria identified on newborn screening; no consanguinity is reported."

Events are described as sudden spells with loss of awareness and generalized stiffening/jerking lasting about 1–2 minutes, followed by several minutes of confusion and marked fatigue; episodes occur roughly every 1–2 months, sometimes after sleep deprivation, and have led to missed school days and restrictions in independent activities. No specific seizure syndrome is documented in available records. Metabolic evaluation has shown repeated biochemical abnormalities, including chronically elevated plasma lactate in the 3.8–4.6 mmol/L range (reference 0.5–2.2) on multiple draws over the past year, with intermittent mild hyperammonemia up to 72 µmol/L (reference <35) during periods of illness, returning closer to baseline afterward; basic electrolytes have otherwise been reported within reference ranges when checked. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. A paternal uncle reportedly has a history of recurrent seizures beginning in adolescence, and a maternal cousin has been followed for persistent unexplained elevations in lactate on screening labs."

She also has congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong lactose intolerance; even small amounts of milk, ice cream, or soft cheeses reliably trigger crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and watery diarrhea within a few hours. Symptoms are persistent rather than episodic and improve with strict lactose avoidance. Recent dietary review supports continued sensitivity to hidden lactose in processed foods. Metabolic evaluation has included stool testing showing repeatedly low lactase activity (0.5 U/g; reference ≥10 U/g) with normal sucrase and maltase, consistent with isolated lactase deficiency, and breath hydrogen testing after lactose challenge with a peak rise of 38 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes.

He also has congenital polycystic kidney disease, described as multiple renal cysts consistent with a hereditary cystic kidney disorder; clinical follow-up has focused on renal involvement rather than acquired causes. Dysmorphic features have been noted on exam, including low-set ears and a flat nasal bridge, in the context of a congenital malformation syndrome affecting multiple systems. The overall phenotype is consistent with a syndromic presentation with both central nervous system and renal involvement, along with characteristic facial findings. Prior genetic workup included single-gene testing performed on 2025-11-13, which was reported as negative."

Metabolic evaluation has shown a lactose malabsorption pattern with a hydrogen breath test demonstrating a rise of 32 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes after lactose load, consistent with persistent lactose sensitivity rather than episodic intolerance. Neurologic history is significant for other generalized epilepsy without status epilepticus, with recurrent generalized convulsive seizures described as sudden loss of awareness followed by bilateral tonic-clonic activity lasting about 1–2 minutes, occurring approximately every 1–2 months, followed by postictal confusion and fatigue that can persist for several hours and has led to missed school days. Family history includes a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in adolescence and a father with longstanding lactose intolerance; parents deny consanguinity."

Caregivers describe recurrent convulsive episodes with impaired awareness, occurring intermittently since infancy, with post-ictal sleepiness and temporary decline in responsiveness afterward; events have been disruptive to daily routines and require close supervision for safety. Her record also documents an “other specified abnormal finding of blood chemistry,” and available laboratory data support a persistent pattern rather than a single transient result, including repeated elevations of serum lactate around 3.2–3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and mildly increased alanine on plasma amino acids (e.g., 610 µmol/L, ref 200–500), noted on more than one draw without clear normalization between episodes. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports no other specifically characterized neurologic diagnoses in close relatives beyond the seizure history described."

Prior laboratory monitoring has shown phenylalanine levels chronically above the expected range (e.g., 620–780 µmol/L on repeat plasma amino acids) with relatively normal tyrosine, and caregivers report dietary sensitivity with higher levels after increased natural protein intake. Neurologic history includes congenital hypotonia, described since infancy as low axial tone with delayed acquisition of head control and ongoing easy fatigability with gross motor tasks; he requires frequent rest breaks during running and climbing and has mild difficulty maintaining upright posture for prolonged sitting. Family history is significant for a sibling with elevated phenylalanine identified on newborn screening and managed with dietary restriction, and a maternal uncle reported to have a similar amino-acid disorder in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and there is no reported family history of neuromuscular disease outside the above.\n\nSecondary medical issues include an acute unintentional exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, an initial encounter for a scalp laceration without foreign body, and an initial encounter for a right ankle sprain involving unspecified ligament, each described as isolated events without chronic sequelae noted in the available history."

Family reports periods of easy fatigability with intercurrent infections and prolonged recovery compared with peers. He also carries a diagnosis of other generalized epilepsy with intractable epilepsy, without status epilepticus, described as recurrent generalized seizures that have persisted despite medication trials, with ongoing breakthrough events that disrupt school attendance and require close supervision for safety. Parents report that seizures are not limited to a single time of day and may cluster during periods of sleep deprivation or febrile illness, though no episodes of status epilepticus are described. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. There is also a reported history of seizures in a maternal uncle and a paternal cousin, though specific epilepsy syndromes are not documented.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories: He has had an accidental exposure/ingestion to a penicillin-class antibiotic prompting acute evaluation, and he also has a documented concussion without loss of consciousness following a head injury, with subsequent monitoring for post-concussive symptoms."

Prior testing includes an outpatient EEG dated 2024-08-14 reported as showing generalized epileptiform discharges, supporting a generalized seizure tendency.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories: He has a documented right ankle sprain from an inversion injury, treated as an acute ligamentous sprain. He also has a history of concussion without loss of consciousness after a minor head impact, with transient headache and light sensitivity noted at the time and subsequent return to baseline per follow-up documentation."

History is notable for a recent head impact followed by symptoms consistent with mild traumatic brain injury, including headache, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating, without any reported blackout or post-event amnesia. She describes increased sensitivity to bright light and screen use since the incident, with symptoms fluctuating through the day and interfering with schoolwork and reading. She also has a facial/head burn sustained around the same timeframe, described as painful with localized redness and tenderness; the depth is not clearly characterized at this visit. She reports discomfort with washing the affected area and notes that exposure to heat worsens the pain. No additional neurologic deficits are described beyond the concussion-related symptoms, and the encounter focuses on documenting the current symptom pattern and functional impact related to the head injury and the burn involving the head and face."

History is focused on the circumstances of the exposure and early symptoms; he has had transient gastrointestinal upset and fatigue since the event, without reported progression to severe systemic manifestations. In the same acute timeframe, he also sustained a concussion without loss of consciousness. Since the head injury, caregivers describe intermittent headache and irritability with brief episodes of dizziness, with reduced tolerance for active play and increased need for rest; there has been no history provided of a blackout at the time of injury. Symptoms have been episodic over the days since the injury and are noted to interfere with usual preschool activities due to fatigue and discomfort.

He also has a sprain involving the right ankle, consistent with an acute twisting injury with pain and swelling around the ankle and difficulty bearing weight immediately afterward. Symptoms have been primarily mechanical, with discomfort worsened by walking and improved with rest and limited activity. Functional impact has included temporary limitation in running and play due to ankle pain, and the scalp wound required attention for bleeding control and wound care. No additional systemic symptoms are described in association with these injuries, and the clinical picture is focused on localized soft-tissue trauma to the scalp and a ligamentous injury at the right ankle."

During these periods, caregivers report reduced stamina and occasional rapid breathing, with symptoms improving as bicarbonate normalizes. Neurologically, he has ongoing difficulties with coordination, including an unsteady gait and frequent tripping, with observable clumsiness during running and stair negotiation; fine motor tasks such as utensil use and handwriting practice are slower than peers and require extra effort. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity; the parents are first cousins.

Caregivers report that he has required extra time for gross motor tasks and has had persistent “floppiness” compared with peers, without characterization here of focal weakness or episodic paralysis. He also carries a diagnosis consistent with congenital lactase deficiency, with symptoms beginning early in life and recurring predictably with lactose exposure, including watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating that improve with strict avoidance of lactose-containing foods and recur with inadvertent intake. Available laboratory documentation includes repeatedly acidic stool pH (~5.0) during symptomatic episodes and low stool reducing substances when lactose is avoided, supporting a dietary trigger pattern rather than a constant baseline complaint. Family history is significant for a paternal aunt with lifelong lactose intolerance requiring avoidance of dairy products and a male maternal cousin reported to have low muscle tone in infancy requiring physical therapy; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Metabolic history is notable for metabolic acidosis with documented low serum bicarbonate; recent chemistry panels have shown CO₂ 15–18 mmol/L on repeated measurements with a corresponding anion gap elevation (e.g., 18–22) and venous blood gas demonstrating acidemia (pH ~7.28–7.32) during symptomatic periods, suggesting a persistent tendency with episodic worsening. During these episodes, caregivers report increased fatigue and reduced appetite, with improvement as bicarbonate normalizes. Family history is significant for seizures in a paternal uncle beginning in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and there is additional report of a maternal cousin with recurrent seizure episodes in early life."

He also carries a history of other generalized epilepsy without status epilepticus, characterized by recurrent generalized seizures; events have occurred without prolonged convulsive episodes or need for emergent treatment for status epilepticus per available history, and the seizure disorder has impacted daily supervision needs. Metabolic evaluation has included repeated evidence of impaired lactose digestion: a lactose hydrogen breath test with a peak rise of 45 ppm above baseline at 60 minutes, and stool reducing substances noted as positive during symptomatic periods, supporting ongoing carbohydrate malabsorption consistent with congenital lactase deficiency. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins.

Caregivers describe recurrent spells of sudden behavioral arrest followed by generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking, typically lasting 1–2 minutes with post-event sleepiness and confusion that can persist for hours; events have occurred both from sleep and while awake and have disrupted school participation due to fatigue the following day. Metabolic history includes intermittent elevations of serum lactate documented on prior evaluations, with representative values rising to 4.8–6.2 mmol/L during intercurrent illnesses and improving to ~2.1 mmol/L when well, consistent with episodic worsening rather than a fixed baseline. During these episodes, caregivers report reduced stamina and increased somnolence compared with baseline. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with a generalized epilepsy syndrome beginning in childhood and a maternal first cousin reported to have a mitochondrial metabolism disorder with recurrent lactic acidosis; parents deny consanguinity."

Metabolic evaluation has been consistent with a mitochondrial metabolic disorder, with episodic elevations of serum lactate during intercurrent illness or exertion (e.g., lactate 3.6–4.2 mmol/L on repeat checks, with a baseline around 1.8 mmol/L when well) and a mildly increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio on prior testing, suggesting a persistent tendency toward lactic acidemia under stress.

Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, with recent values around 980 µmol/L (reference 30–120) and earlier readings in the 700–900 µmol/L range, with episodic worsening during periods of dietary lapse; tyrosine has been low-normal at 35 µmol/L (reference 40–90). Clinically, the family reports fluctuations in attention and school stamina that seem to parallel these higher phenylalanine periods. Seizure history includes generalized convulsive events with postictal fatigue; events have occurred intermittently over the past year, with variable frequency and occasional clustering over a few days, impacting school attendance and requiring increased supervision during higher-risk periods. Family history is significant for a sibling with the same phenylalanine metabolism disorder and a maternal cousin with a seizure disorder; parents deny known consanguinity."

With intake of lactose-containing foods, she has recurrent episodes of watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating that improve with strict lactose avoidance; family reports symptoms recur reliably within hours of dairy exposure. Metabolic evaluation has shown a persistent pattern consistent with lactase deficiency, including a lactose hydrogen breath test previously demonstrating a rise in breath hydrogen to 42 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes, with normal fasting glucose and no hypoglycemia reported. Neurologic history is notable for ataxia with impaired coordination affecting gait and fine motor tasks; she is described as unsteady with a wide-based gait and has difficulty with rapid alternating movements, leading to slower participation in sports and occasional near-falls, without describing a progressive course in this record. Family history is significant for a brother with similar lactose-triggered gastrointestinal symptoms in childhood and a maternal aunt with longstanding coordination problems characterized by balance difficulty."

Events have occurred a few times per year, without a consistent trigger, and have led to missed school days due to prolonged post-event sleepiness. He also has documented metabolic acidosis with repeated low serum bicarbonate on chemistry panels; the family reports this has been persistent rather than episodic. Representative prior laboratory data include CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on multiple checks with a concurrent elevated anion gap around 18–20, consistent with ongoing acid-base derangement; symptoms during lower bicarbonate periods include decreased exercise tolerance and nausea without focal infectious symptoms. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in adolescence and recurrent metabolic acidosis in an older sibling requiring periodic emergency evaluation. The parents are first cousins, and there is no known history of similar findings in prior generations beyond those noted."

Per caregiver report, low muscle tone was first recognized in the newborn period with “floppiness” and reduced spontaneous antigravity movements, requiring close monitoring early in life; tone improved over time but she continues to fatigue more quickly than peers with prolonged activity. Metabolic evaluation has been consistent with a mitochondrial metabolic disorder, with episodic biochemical decompensation during intercurrent illnesses characterized by elevated serum lactate (typically 3.5–5.2 mmol/L; baseline ~1.8–2.2 mmol/L) and increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (reported 25–32 during episodes), with partial normalization when well. Caregivers describe that episodes are associated with decreased stamina and need for frequent rest, but without additional neurologic focality described in today’s history. Family history is significant for a maternal aunt with a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic disorder and exercise intolerance, and a maternal cousin with early hypotonia in infancy; parents deny consanguinity.

    "clinical_note": "Rowan Montrose is a 13-year-old male with history notable for neonatal hypotonia described as a “floppy infant” presentation, with reduced spontaneous antigravity movements and poor flexor tone in early life. Chart review also documents persistent laboratory findings categorized as other specified abnormal blood chemistry; available prior results show recurrent elevations in serum lactate in the 3.2–4.1 mmol/L range (reference 0.5–2.2) on repeat outpatient draws, with intermittent mild elevation of plasma ammonia to 62–78 µmol/L (reference 11–35), without documentation of acute decompensation at the times tested. No additional specific metabolic diagnosis is recorded in the provided data. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. There is also a reported history of an affected sibling who had marked neonatal hypotonia requiring prolonged feeding support in infancy, though no definitive etiology is documented in the available record. The encounter focuses on clarifying the phenotype characterized by early hypotonia and the pattern of persistent, analyte-specific blood chemistry abnormalities as above."

Parents report longstanding clumsiness with impaired balance, with a wide-based, unsteady gait and frequent tripping, most apparent during running and stair climbing and limiting participation in sports. On exam, coordination is abnormal with difficulty performing rapid alternating movements and tandem walking, consistent with ataxia as an observable neurologic sign rather than a separate diagnosis. Metabolic monitoring has shown chronically elevated plasma phenylalanine levels with dietary sensitivity; recent values include phenylalanine 980 µmol/L (ref 120–360) with tyrosine 38 µmol/L (ref 45–90), with similar elevations documented on prior checks, supporting a persistent biochemical pattern. Family history is significant for an older brother with the same phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring ongoing dietary management; parents report they are first cousins.

Neurologically, he has longstanding gait and coordination difficulty described as truncal unsteadiness with frequent stumbling, difficulty with tandem walking, and impaired balance on stairs; symptoms are present daily and interfere with running and age-appropriate sports participation. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a similar disorder of phenylalanine metabolism diagnosed in childhood and managed with dietary modification, and a maternal first cousin with chronic coordination problems characterized by an unsteady gait.

Neurologic exam observations in the record are consistent with impaired coordination rather than isolated weakness. Metabolic evaluation has shown a persistent elevation of serum lactate, typically 3.2–4.6 mmol/L on repeated measurements, with episodic worsening during intercurrent illness to ~6.1 mmol/L; lactate-to-pyruvate ratios have also been elevated (around 28–32), supporting a chronic metabolic pattern rather than a single transient abnormality. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, including a maternal uncle with chronic gait unsteadiness and exercise intolerance and a younger brother with delayed motor coordination and recurrent elevated lactate on screening labs.

The record also documents other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry; available laboratory data show recurrent elevations in serum lactate (3.6–4.8 mmol/L, ref 0.5–2.2) and intermittent mild hyperammonemia (ammonia 78–96 µmol/L, ref 11–35) on repeat testing, including outside of acute illness, suggesting a persistent biochemical pattern rather than a single transient abnormality. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood and a paternal cousin with recurrent generalized seizures; no parental consanguinity is reported. No prior genetic or metabolic test type, date, or result information is available in the provided record beyond the above chemistry findings."

He is also followed for congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong lactose intolerance; even small amounts of lactose trigger predictable gastrointestinal symptoms, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and watery diarrhea within hours of exposure, leading the family to maintain a strict lactose-free diet. Metabolic evaluation has been consistent with impaired lactose digestion, with persistently low lactase activity on prior assessment and repeated breath hydrogen testing demonstrating a marked rise after lactose challenge (e.g., increase of ~35–45 ppm over baseline at 90–120 minutes), supporting an ongoing, diet-sensitive pattern rather than episodic illness. Family history is significant for similar lactose intolerance in a paternal uncle and a sibling with early-life low muscle tone requiring physical therapy. The parents are first cousins, and they report multiple relatives on both sides with childhood feeding intolerance to dairy products."

Developmentally, she demonstrates a specific motor coordination disorder, with persistent difficulty in age-expected gross and fine motor tasks; caregivers report clumsiness and trouble with activities requiring balance and coordinated hand use, with functional impact on play and early school participation. On exam she appears dysmorphic with mild facial asymmetry and a low-set, abnormally shaped ear consistent with her known congenital pattern.

Symptoms are described as clumsiness with difficulty maintaining balance during walking and running, with occasional stumbling and trouble with tandem gait; fine motor tasks such as rapid alternating movements and handwriting are also affected. Neurologic exam documentation from prior visits notes a broad-based gait pattern without a clear episodic trigger pattern reported. Metabolic evaluation has identified persistent abnormal blood chemistry findings characterized by chronically elevated plasma lactate (typically 3.5–4.8 mmol/L on repeat measurements) with intermittently increased anion gap (up to 18–20) and mild transaminase elevation (AST/ALT in the 50–80 U/L range), without a single unifying diagnosis recorded in the chart. These laboratory findings have been present on more than one draw rather than a single isolated result. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with longstanding balance problems described as “coordination difficulties” since adolescence, and a paternal cousin with similar gait unsteadiness; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Metabolic monitoring has included serial carbohydrate tolerance testing showing persistently low lactase activity with symptomatic lactose challenges and no evidence of improvement over time; representative recent testing documented marked lactose malabsorption with a blunted rise in blood glucose after oral lactose and associated abdominal cramping during the observation period. Neurologic history is significant for epilepsy characterized by other generalized seizures that have occurred intermittently, with episodes described as generalized convulsive events with postictal sleepiness and temporary functional impairment afterward. Family history is contributory for seizures in a first-degree relative, with the patient’s father reported to have a history of generalized seizure disorder beginning in adolescence.

Fine motor coordination is also affected, with clumsiness during tasks requiring precise hand control. In addition, he has a documented metabolic derangement characterized by metabolic acidosis. Prior laboratory data have shown persistently low serum bicarbonate in the range of 14–18 mmol/L with an elevated anion gap around 18–22, with venous blood gas values demonstrating acidemia (pH approximately 7.28–7.32) during symptomatic periods, consistent with episodic worsening on a chronic baseline. Family history is significant for similar neurologic coordination problems in a paternal uncle and recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis in a maternal aunt requiring emergency evaluation. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives from the shared lineage with comparable balance difficulties and “acid buildup” episodes."

On exam, coordination appears impaired with an ataxic gait pattern and difficulty with tandem walking, without implying a separate neurologic diagnosis beyond the observed incoordination. Metabolic monitoring has shown a pattern consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including intermittently elevated venous lactate (typically 3.8–5.2 mmol/L, rising during intercurrent illness) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (approximately 28–32) and episodic mild elevation of alanine on plasma amino acids; these abnormalities have recurred across multiple draws rather than representing a single isolated result.

Since infancy he has had a congenital eyelid malformation, described by caregivers as an abnormal eyelid appearance present from birth that affects the contour of the lid margin. Cardiac history includes an atrial septal defect characterized as a persistent interatrial communication identified in childhood, followed clinically as a congenital heart defect. Neurodevelopmental history is significant for developmental delay with prominent speech and language impairment; family reports delayed acquisition of expressive language and ongoing difficulty with age-expected speech clarity and sentence formation, impacting communication at home and in structured settings. Dysmorphic features are described as downslanting palpebral fissures and mild midface hypoplasia, consistent with the broader craniofacial syndrome diagnosis. Prior genetic evaluation included a gene panel performed on 2025-09-02, reported as negative."

Craniofacial findings include congenital ptosis affecting the eyelids, and she has been described as having dysmorphic facial features with a short palpebral fissure and a broad nasal bridge. Cardiac history includes an atrial septal defect, with clinical follow-up focused on the presence of an interatrial communication rather than acquired heart disease symptoms. Neuroimaging history is notable for agenesis of the corpus callosum, with associated developmental differences. Speech and language development has been delayed, characterized by limited expressive language for age and difficulty with age-appropriate articulation and language comprehension, impacting communication in daily activities. Overall, her presentation is consistent with a congenital malformation syndrome involving multiple systems, with the above ocular, cardiac, and central nervous system findings documented since early childhood.

Episodes have been associated at times with metabolic decompensation marked by metabolic acidosis. Available laboratory documentation includes persistently low serum bicarbonate in the 14–18 mmol/L range with a corresponding elevated anion gap (typically 18–22), with venous blood gas pH around 7.28–7.33 during symptomatic periods and partial improvement between episodes, suggesting an episodic pattern rather than a single isolated finding. During more significant events, caregivers report reduced energy and decreased oral intake, with symptoms improving as acidosis resolves. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood and a paternal cousin with recurrent convulsions; no consanguinity is reported. The combination of seizure burden and episodic acidosis has had functional impact through missed school days and need for close supervision around periods of increased seizure frequency."

Per available records, she had low muscle tone as a newborn with reduced spontaneous movement and poor antigravity strength, requiring early supportive care and ongoing monitoring of motor development. The mitochondrial metabolism disorder has been followed with targeted biochemical surveillance; recent plasma lactate has been persistently elevated in the mild-to-moderate range (e.g., 3.6–4.4 mmol/L on repeat draws, reference 0.5–2.2) with intermittent alanine elevation (e.g., 620 µmol/L, reference 150–450), described as fluctuating rather than a single isolated finding. Clinical course is described as chronic rather than episodic, with laboratory abnormalities noted on more than one occasion. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. There is also a reported family history of a similarly affected relative, with a maternal cousin noted to have a mitochondrial metabolism disorder and early life hypotonia."

He has an established mitochondrial metabolism disorder, described as a chronic condition with episodic metabolic decompensation during intercurrent illnesses. Prior laboratory documentation has shown persistent elevation of plasma lactate (typically 3.8–5.1 mmol/L; ref 0.5–2.2) with intermittent lactate:pyruvate ratio elevation (about 28–34; ref <20), and episodic mild metabolic acidosis during febrile viral infections (bicarbonate 16–18 mmol/L). Between episodes, energy level is variable but he returns to baseline functioning. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, including a maternal uncle with a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolism disorder and longstanding gait incoordination, and a maternal cousin with childhood-onset coordination difficulties consistent with ataxia. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports no other specific neurologic diagnoses beyond the above."

Fine motor coordination is also affected, with clumsiness during handwriting and utensil use. Metabolic evaluation has identified persistent, nonspecific abnormalities on blood chemistry testing, documented on repeat measurements rather than a single episode. Recent labs have shown chronically elevated serum lactate around 3.4–3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and mildly increased plasma alanine approximately 560 µmol/L (ref 200–500), with otherwise stable basic metabolic parameters.

Since infancy she has had positional skull asymmetry consistent with plagiocephaly, and exam has been described with mild facial asymmetry. Ocular history includes congenital eyelid malposition consistent with ectropion, with intermittent exposure-related irritation reported by caregivers. Developmentally, she carries a diagnosis of developmental disorder of speech and language, with delayed expressive language and reduced intelligibility compared with peers, impacting communication at preschool and requiring ongoing supportive services. Overall appearance is described as dysmorphic with a syndromic gestalt rather than isolated findings, and the above craniofacial and eyelid features are the most prominent noted. Cardiac history centers on the atrial septal defect; no additional structural lesions are documented here. Prior genetic testing included a single-gene test performed on 2025-09-02, which was negative."

Symptoms are reproducible with lactose exposure and improve with strict lactose avoidance; inadvertent exposures lead to episodic dehydration and fatigue but no chronic weight loss is described. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently low intestinal lactase activity on prior workup, and supportive blood testing during symptomatic episodes has demonstrated mild non–anion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate ~18–20 mmol/L) consistent with gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss. Neurologic history includes prior episodes of seizures without a specified epilepsy syndrome; events are described as sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting 1–2 minutes, followed by postictal sleepiness, with intermittent recurrence rather than daily spells. Family history is significant for a father with lifelong lactose intolerance requiring dietary restriction and a maternal aunt with recurrent seizures beginning in adolescence; there is no reported parental consanguinity."

Events are described as abrupt spells of impaired awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting 1–3 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for up to an hour; frequency has varied from rare isolated episodes to clusters during intercurrent illness, with associated missed school days and need for supervision. Metabolic monitoring has shown a persistent lactic acid elevation consistent with impaired oxidative metabolism, with venous lactate typically 3.8–5.2 mmol/L (baseline on repeat checks) and episodic worsening to 7.1 mmol/L during febrile periods; accompanying serum bicarbonate has been mildly low at times (18–20 mmol/L), with partial improvement as symptoms resolve. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in adolescence and a maternal cousin with a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolism disorder; the parents are first cousins. No prior genetic test results were provided in the record for review."

He also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong intolerance to lactose-containing foods; parents report reproducible watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and increased gas within a few hours of dairy exposure, improving with strict lactose avoidance and use of lactose-free alternatives. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently low lactase activity on prior intestinal enzyme testing with supportive carbohydrate malabsorption pattern, and recent stool studies during symptomatic periods have demonstrated acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances. Family history is significant for epilepsy in a paternal uncle with onset in adolescence and for similar lifelong dairy intolerance in the patient’s mother. The parents are first cousins, and they report multiple shared relatives with childhood-onset lactose intolerance."

Episodes of metabolic decompensation have been characterized by low serum bicarbonate with an elevated anion gap, including a representative chemistry showing CO₂ 14 mmol/L with anion gap 22 and venous pH 7.28, with recurrence on repeat testing suggesting a persistent tendency toward acidosis rather than a single transient event. During these episodes, caregivers report worsened lethargy and decreased activity tolerance, with gradual improvement as acid–base status normalizes.

Neurodevelopmental history includes a brain malformation consistent with holoprosencephaly, associated with global developmental delay and need for ongoing assistance with age-appropriate academic and adaptive skills. Communication has been impacted by a developmental disorder of speech and language, with persistent delays in expressive language and articulation that limit intelligibility in unfamiliar settings and contribute to frustration during longer conversations. He has dysmorphic features in a pattern consistent with a defined congenital malformation syndrome, including midface hypoplasia and closely spaced eyes noted on exam. There is also a history of multiple congenital anomalies affecting more than one organ system, with early-life medical complexity and multispecialty involvement. Prior genetic testing included chromosomal microarray (CMA) performed on 2025-12-26, reported as negative."

Caregivers describe predictable gastrointestinal intolerance after lactose exposure, with episodic loose stools and abdominal discomfort that improve when lactose is avoided; symptoms recur with inadvertent dairy intake. Metabolic evaluation has included carbohydrate intolerance testing consistent with lactase deficiency, with stool studies during symptomatic episodes showing acidic stool (pH ~5.0) and positive reducing substances (2+), supporting ongoing lactose malabsorption rather than a transient illness. Neurologically, he has persistent ataxia characterized by an unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, with frequent stumbling and difficulty with tasks requiring balance, such as running or climbing stairs; symptoms are present daily and impact age-appropriate play. There is no description of focal weakness in the available history. Family history is significant for similar lactose intolerance in a sibling and chronic gait unsteadiness in a paternal uncle. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives from the same lineage with dairy intolerance and coordination difficulties."

Metabolic history is significant for documented acidosis with low serum bicarbonate on multiple measurements, including a recent basic metabolic panel showing CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16 mmol/L (ref 22–28) with an anion gap of 18, consistent with metabolic acidosis; family reports episodes tend to coincide with intercurrent illness and reduced oral intake, and follow-up testing has again shown bicarbonate in the 15–18 mmol/L range, suggesting persistence rather than a single isolated abnormality.

He was born with a congenital foot deformity described as an “other congenital deformity of the feet,” with persistent positional asymmetry affecting stance and gait mechanics. Ocular history includes congenital eyelid malformation, described as an other congenital malformation of the eyelid, noted since infancy and associated with visible eyelid contour asymmetry. Developmentally, he carries a diagnosis of specific developmental disorder of motor function, with delayed acquisition of gross and fine motor skills relative to peers, including difficulty with coordinated running, stair negotiation, and age-appropriate utensil use, which has impacted participation in play and preschool activities. Examination is also notable for a dysmorphic appearance with facial asymmetry and low-set ears, consistent with a congenital malformation syndrome predominantly affecting facial appearance. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2025-12-12, which was reported as negative."

Parents report intermittent gait unsteadiness with a wide-based, veering walk and frequent stumbling, more noticeable with fatigue and during fast running; fine motor control can appear shaky during tasks requiring balance and coordination. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine consistent with a phenylalanine metabolism disorder, with recent representative values around 780 µmol/L (reference 30–120 µmol/L) and episodic higher readings during dietary lapses; tyrosine has been relatively low-normal at 45 µmol/L (reference 35–110 µmol/L). Symptoms have had functional impact at school and sports due to balance difficulty and slower participation in activities requiring coordination. Family history is notable for similarly affected relatives: a paternal uncle with the same phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring dietary management, and a maternal cousin reported to have chronic elevated phenylalanine levels. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives on both sides with dietary-treated phenylalanine metabolism problems."

His medical history also includes metabolic acidosis with documented low serum bicarbonate on multiple checks, described as persistent rather than a single transient finding; recent representative labs include bicarbonate 16–18 mmol/L with a corresponding low CO₂ on basic metabolic panels, consistent with an ongoing acid–base disturbance. Symptoms around periods of worse acidosis have included fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, though no specific precipitant is established in the record. Family history is significant for seizures in a paternal uncle and a maternal cousin, both reported to have recurrent convulsive episodes beginning in adolescence.

She carries a diagnosis of congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting facial appearance; on exam she has dysmorphic features including facial asymmetry and a flattened midface contour. Craniofacial history also includes other congenital musculoskeletal deformity of the skull, described by caregivers as an atypical head shape noted since infancy and persistent over time. Cardiac history includes an atrial septal defect consistent with an ostium secundum-type defect; this has been followed clinically without acute cardiopulmonary symptoms reported today. There is no additional symptom complex described beyond the above congenital findings and neurodevelopmental impairment. Prior genetic evaluation included chromosomal microarray testing performed on 2025-10-02, which was negative."

Ongoing examination history has emphasized reduced muscle tone rather than fixed weakness, with functional impact on endurance and coordination for age-appropriate sports and prolonged standing. He also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency, with symptoms consistent with lactose exposure: recurrent watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping shortly after ingestion of milk-based products, improving with strict lactose avoidance. Prior metabolic documentation includes repeated low lactase activity on intestinal enzyme testing and diet-sensitive symptoms; representative recent stool studies during symptomatic episodes have shown acidic stool (pH 5.2) with positive reducing substances (2+), supporting carbohydrate malabsorption in the setting of lactose intake. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, including a paternal uncle with lifelong intolerance to lactose-containing foods and a younger sibling with early hypotonia requiring physical therapy. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives on both sides with comparable dairy-triggered gastrointestinal symptoms since childhood."

Since infancy, she has had bilateral microtia with small, underdeveloped external ears, and congenital malformation of the eyelid characterized by ectropion with outward turning of the lid margin, contributing to intermittent ocular surface irritation. Cardiac history includes an atrial septal defect, described as a persistent interatrial communication, followed clinically since early childhood. Dysmorphic features are present, including microtia and eyelid malposition, in the setting of a congenital malformation syndrome that has been used to describe her overall pattern of anomalies. Neurodevelopmentally, she carries an intellectual disability diagnosis with global functional impact and requires ongoing support for learning and daily adaptive skills. Speech and language development has been delayed, with limited expressive language for age and reduced intelligibility affecting communication at home and in structured settings. Prior genetic evaluation included a gene panel performed on 2025-11-23, which was reported as negative."

He also carries a history of acidosis with metabolic features; available laboratory data are consistent with episodic low serum bicarbonate and low CO₂ on chemistry panels, for example bicarbonate 16–18 mmol/L with an anion gap around 18–20 during symptomatic periods, with partial improvement toward baseline (bicarbonate ~22 mmol/L) between episodes. During these episodes, caregivers describe fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, without attributing a specific etiology beyond the documented acid-base disturbance. Family history is significant for seizures in a first-degree relative (mother with a history of generalized seizures beginning in adolescence) and a maternal uncle with recurrent seizure disorder; no parental consanguinity is reported. The combination of recurrent generalized seizures and intermittent metabolic acidosis has prompted ongoing specialty follow-up for characterization of seizure pattern and monitoring of acid-base status."

Prior metabolic evaluation has shown repeatedly low lactase activity on stool enzyme testing, and during symptomatic periods he has had mild non–anion gap metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate 18–20 mmol/L) and dehydration markers that resolve with rehydration and dietary restriction. Neurologic history includes episodic seizures without a specified type, described as sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic jerking lasting ~1–2 minutes, followed by postictal sleepiness; frequency is variable with months between events, and there is no consistent trigger reported. Family history is significant for similar lactose intolerance symptoms in the father and paternal grandmother, and a maternal uncle with recurrent seizures. Parents are first cousins."

These episodes have been described as intermittent, with return toward baseline between events, and have at times limited participation in school and sports due to low stamina. Neurologically, she has had persistent incoordination with an unsteady gait and difficulty with rapid alternating movements; family reports frequent tripping and reduced accuracy with fine motor tasks such as handwriting, without describing a fixed weakness. Family history is significant for similar episodic “acidotic spells” in a maternal uncle and long-standing gait unsteadiness in an older sibling.

Records describe decreased tone in the newborn period with “floppiness” and reduced spontaneous antigravity movement, requiring close feeding support early in life; tone has remained a prominent neurologic feature in his history with easy fatigability during prolonged physical activity. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistent elevation of plasma phenylalanine consistent with impaired aromatic amino-acid handling, with representative values including phenylalanine 980 µmol/L (ref 30–120) on one draw and 760 µmol/L on repeat testing several months later, while tyrosine has been comparatively low-normal at 42 µmol/L (ref 35–110). The biochemical pattern has been described as chronic rather than episodic, without clear illness-related spikes documented. Family history is notable for relatives with similar metabolic findings; a maternal cousin reportedly carries the same aromatic amino-acid metabolism disorder and required ongoing biochemical surveillance, and an older sibling has a history of low tone in infancy. No consanguinity is reported."

Caregivers report that these episodes have disrupted school participation and require close supervision for safety. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent lactic acid elevation consistent with impaired oxidative metabolism, with venous lactate typically 3.8–5.6 mmol/L (baseline on well days) and rising to 6.9 mmol/L during febrile episodes; serum pyruvate has also been elevated (0.18–0.24 mmol/L) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a childhood-onset seizure disorder and a maternal grandmother with a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic condition characterized by chronically elevated lactate; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Metabolic monitoring has shown persistent elevation of plasma phenylalanine, with recent values in the 520–680 µmol/L range on serial measurements, while tyrosine has been relatively low-normal (e.g., ~45–55 µmol/L), consistent with ongoing biochemical elevation rather than a single transient spike. Caregivers report sensitivity of phenylalanine levels to dietary protein intake, with higher readings after less restricted periods. Neurologically, he has had intermittent seizure events without a specified syndrome; episodes are described as sudden staring with unresponsiveness and occasional generalized shaking, lasting 1–2 minutes with post-event fatigue, occurring a few times per year and prompting emergency evaluation on at least one occasion. No additional seizure semiology is documented beyond these observable events. Family history is significant for a sibling with elevated phenylalanine levels requiring dietary management, and a maternal cousin reported to have a childhood seizure history. Parents deny known consanguinity."

Examination today remains consistent with generalized hypotonia without a fixed contracture pattern. Dysmorphic features are subtle but include mild midface hypoplasia and slightly low-set ears. A metabolic phenotype has been followed with episodic lactic acid elevations, including a documented venous lactate of 4.6 mmol/L during intercurrent illness with subsequent partial improvement to 2.3 mmol/L at baseline, consistent with a recurrent pattern rather than a single isolated result.

Neurodevelopmental history is significant for moderate intellectual disability with global learning limitations requiring substantial educational supports and assistance with adaptive skills; caregivers describe persistent difficulty with academic progress and problem-solving compared with peers. His overall pattern of multiple congenital anomalies is consistent with a VACTERL-type association, reflected by the combination of cardiac, tracheoesophageal, and ear malformations. Prior genetic evaluation included chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-08-28, which was reported as negative."

Congenital findings include polycystic kidney disease, with longstanding renal cysts described in prior records, and congenital heart disease consistent with pulmonary valve atresia. Dysmorphic features are present, including a small or underdeveloped external ear and facial asymmetry. Her overall pattern of congenital anomalies is consistent with Goldenhar syndrome, and clinical documentation reflects multisystem involvement rather than an isolated finding. No acute decompensation is described in today’s record, but the congenital conditions have required longitudinal specialty follow-up across childhood. Family history is not documented as contributory in the available information. Prior genetic testing is noted: chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-09-02 was negative."

Seizure frequency has fluctuated, with clusters during intercurrent illness and sleep deprivation, and the family reports functional impact including missed school days and need for close supervision around bathing and heights. The record also documents metabolic acidosis with low serum bicarbonate on repeated chemistry panels; most recent available values include CO₂ 15–18 mmol/L with a corresponding anion gap elevation during symptomatic periods, and intermittent tachypnea and fatigue when the acidosis worsens, suggesting episodic exacerbations on a background of chronically low bicarbonate. Dysmorphic features are noted on exam, including a broad nasal bridge and low-set ears. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in childhood and a paternal cousin with recurrent seizures; parents deny consanguinity.

Renal history is notable for congenital medullary sponge kidney, with prior clinical documentation of nephrocalcinosis risk and episodic hematuria prompting renal imaging consistent with this diagnosis. Neurodevelopmentally, he has developmental coordination disorder with persistent fine- and gross-motor coordination challenges that affect age-appropriate tasks such as handwriting, dressing skills, and playground activities, without describing a broader cognitive diagnosis. Dysmorphic features on exam are described as mild facial asymmetry and external ear asymmetry. Prior genetic testing included a single-gene test performed on 2026-01-20, reported as negative."

Between events, energy and stamina are described as inconsistent, with periods of marked fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent lactic acid elevation, with plasma lactate typically 3.8–5.6 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and episodic worsening during acute stress (reported peak 7.1 mmol/L), with a mildly increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Dysmorphic features noted on exam include a long, narrow face and mildly low-set ears. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures and a maternal cousin with a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic condition.

Caregivers report episodic worsening with intercurrent illness and poor oral intake. Prior metabolic monitoring has shown chronically elevated blood lactate around 3.6–4.8 mmol/L (reference <2.0) with intermittent elevation of plasma alanine (e.g., 610 µmol/L, reference 200–500), supporting a metabolic phenotype consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. Neurologically, she has recurrent generalized seizure events with breakthrough episodes despite ongoing management, with postictal fatigue affecting school participation and requiring close supervision for safety. Dysmorphic features are described as mild, including a long narrow face and low-set ears on exam. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, and the parents are first cousins; a maternal uncle reportedly has a mitochondrial metabolic disorder with seizures, and a paternal cousin has generalized epilepsy. A gene panel performed on 2025-11-15 was negative."

Records describe persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine on serial monitoring, typically in the 420–680 µmol/L range with episodic rises above 800 µmol/L during intercurrent illness; tyrosine has been low-normal (e.g., 42–55 µmol/L). Symptoms attributed to impaired coordination include an unsteady, wide-based gait with clumsiness and difficulty with tandem walking, leading to frequent trips and reduced participation in sports and other balance-demanding activities. On exam she has observable dysmorphic features including mild hypertelorism and a smooth/long philtrum. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives: a younger brother with documented elevated phenylalanine levels and a maternal uncle described as having chronic coordination problems with an unsteady gait.

Parents describe that her facial appearance has been distinctive since infancy, with mild facial asymmetry and low-set ears noted on prior examinations. Motor development has been persistently affected, with a pattern consistent with specific developmental disorder of motor function; she has had difficulty with age-appropriate coordination and fine motor tasks, including challenges with handwriting readiness, utensil use, and navigating stairs without support, which has impacted participation in preschool activities. Gait has been described as awkward at times, and the congenital foot difference has contributed to problems with shoe fit and prolonged walking. Ocular history includes a congenital eyelid malformation, with intermittent irritation and cosmetic asymmetry reported by caregivers. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2026-01-20, which was negative."

Neurologic history includes intermittent generalized convulsive events with postictal sleepiness and next-day fatigue; events have occurred in clusters during periods of missed sleep per family report, without documented status epilepticus. Dysmorphic features are noted on exam as mild hypertelorism and a low nasal bridge. Family history is significant for a father with a history of generalized seizures beginning in adolescence and a paternal aunt with lactose intolerance; parents deny consanguinity.

Neurologic exam is described as consistent with ataxia, without additional localizing features documented today. Metabolic monitoring has shown a chronic pattern of elevated lactate, with recent venous lactate 3.8–4.6 mmol/L on repeat checks over several months (reference 0.5–2.2), and intermittent mild metabolic acidosis during intercurrent illnesses (bicarbonate as low as 18 mmol/L), returning toward baseline when well. Symptoms fluctuate with physiologic stress, with caregivers noting worsening coordination and fatigue during febrile episodes.

Caregivers report that even small amounts of milk, ice cream, or cheese reliably trigger crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and watery diarrhea within a few hours, leading to avoidance of dairy and reliance on lactose-free products. Metabolic evaluation has shown a persistent lactase enzyme deficiency pattern, with a prior lactose hydrogen breath test demonstrating a rise in breath hydrogen from 12 ppm at baseline to 68 ppm at 90 minutes after lactose load, consistent with marked lactose malabsorption; symptoms reproducibly occur with dietary exposure rather than in episodic flares. Neurologic history includes seizures of unclear type, described as sudden episodes of loss of awareness with generalized shaking lasting 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness; frequency has varied from none for months to clusters of two events in a week. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle and lactose intolerance requiring lactose avoidance in the patient’s father. The parents are first cousins."

Neurologic exam history has emphasized decreased resistance to passive movement and reduced spontaneous antigravity movements early in life, without characterization here of a specific neuromuscular diagnosis. Metabolic evaluation has been pursued for persistent, nonspecific abnormal blood chemistry findings; available records note repeat laboratory flagging of atypical analyte values on multiple occasions rather than a single transient result. Representative prior results include intermittently elevated plasma lactate around 3.1–3.6 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and mild, persistent transaminase elevation with AST ~68 U/L and ALT ~74 U/L (ref <40), prompting continued monitoring. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. A maternal uncle reportedly had marked neonatal “floppiness” and required early supportive therapies, and a paternal cousin had recurrent unexplained abnormal chemistry panels in childhood, though no specific diagnoses are documented in the available history."

Neurologic exam history is characterized by generalized “floppiness” rather than focal weakness, with functional impact on endurance and coordination-based activities. Metabolic history is notable for congenital lactase deficiency with symptoms beginning early in life when exposed to lactose-containing feeds, including reproducible watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and excessive gas shortly after dairy intake; symptoms improve with strict lactose avoidance and recur with accidental exposures. Available laboratory documentation includes persistently low lactase activity on prior intestinal enzyme analysis (reported at 1.2 U/g; reference ≥10 U/g) and episodic acidic stool during symptomatic periods (pH 5.0) consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption.

Since infancy, caregivers have described low muscle tone with “floppiness” and reduced antigravity movements, with delayed acquisition of head control and ongoing easy fatigability during prolonged play; tone has gradually improved but she still benefits from extra time for gross-motor tasks compared with peers. Metabolic history includes persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine on serial monitoring, with representative recent values in the 420–560 µmol/L range and tyrosine in the low-normal range (e.g., ~45–55 µmol/L), without reported episodic crises; levels fluctuate with dietary protein intake and are followed longitudinally. Family history is significant for a sibling with documented hyperphenylalaninemia requiring ongoing biochemical monitoring, and a maternal cousin reported to have elevated phenylalanine identified on newborn screening. Parents deny consanguinity."

In addition, he carries a history of acidosis with metabolic derangements documented on prior chemistry testing; recent episodes have shown a low serum bicarbonate in the 15–18 mmol/L range with a corresponding elevated anion gap around 18–22, consistent with clinically significant acidemia during symptomatic periods, with partial improvement on repeat testing between episodes (bicarbonate rising to ~20–22 mmol/L). During more pronounced episodes, caregivers report associated fatigue and decreased activity tolerance, which tend to improve as the acidosis resolves. Family history is notable for seizures in a first-degree relative, with the patient’s maternal uncle reported to have had recurrent generalized seizures beginning in adolescence, and a paternal cousin with a similar seizure history; no consanguinity is reported. Overall history reflects coexisting seizure disorder and episodic metabolic acidosis documented by objective laboratory findings."

Between events, she returns to baseline but the unpredictability has affected supervision needs at school and during bathing. Her record also documents persistent nonspecific abnormal laboratory findings; recent chemistry testing has shown chronically elevated serum lactate around 3.6–4.2 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) with intermittent mild elevation in anion gap (up to 18) and occasional low bicarbonate to 19–20 mmol/L, noted on repeat samples rather than a single isolated draw. No specific metabolic diagnosis is stated in the available information beyond these measured abnormalities. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood and recurrent unexplained “abnormal blood tests” in a paternal aunt per family report. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports no other known neurologic conditions in first-degree relatives."

    "clinical_note": "Leona Underwood is a 6-year-old female with history notable for lactose intolerance and episodic seizures. Caregivers describe recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms after dairy exposure, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools that reliably occur within a few hours of milk, ice cream, or soft cheeses; symptoms improve with lactose avoidance and use of lactose-free alternatives, with normal tolerance of non-dairy foods. Metabolic evaluation has shown a lactose challenge with a rise in breath hydrogen from 12 ppm at baseline to 58 ppm at 90 minutes, consistent with lactose malabsorption, and this pattern has been persistent across repeat testing during symptomatic periods. Neurologic history includes intermittent generalized seizure-like episodes without a specified epilepsy syndrome; events have occurred a few times per year, characterized by sudden loss of awareness with whole-body stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting ~1–2 minutes followed by post-event sleepiness for 30–60 minutes, with no clear fever trigger reported. Family history is significant for seizures in a paternal uncle and lactose intolerance in the mother. The parents are first cousins."

Caregivers report that since infancy he has had reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose exposure, including crampy abdominal discomfort and loose stools, with improvement when lactose is avoided and recurrence with accidental dairy intake. Given the metabolic nature of this condition, prior evaluations have included carbohydrate malabsorption testing consistent with lactase deficiency, with a lactose challenge producing an elevated breath hydrogen peak (e.g., rise to 45 ppm above baseline) and associated symptoms; symptoms have been chronic rather than episodic and are clearly diet-sensitive. Neurologically, he also has ataxia characterized by unsteady gait and impaired coordination, with difficulty running and frequent stumbling noted during routine activities; this has affected participation in sports and requires extra time for stairs and uneven surfaces. Family history is significant for a sibling with similar lactose intolerance symptoms and a maternal uncle with longstanding coordination difficulties described as gait unsteadiness."

Caregivers report an unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent falls, difficulty running, and trouble with age-appropriate stair negotiation; fine motor tasks such as utensil use and stacking blocks are slower and less precise than peers. Neurologic symptoms are described as persistent rather than episodic, with variable day-to-day severity but no clear provoking factors documented. Laboratory history is notable for other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry, with repeat testing showing persistent mild elevation of serum lactate (2.8–3.4 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2) and intermittently increased alanine (peaks 560 µmol/L; reference 200–500), without accompanying narrative of acute illness at the time of draws. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a long-standing balance disorder described as gait unsteadiness beginning in childhood, and a paternal cousin with similar coordination difficulties; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. Relatives on the maternal side are reported to have a history of similar unexplained laboratory abnormalities on routine testing, and one paternal cousin reportedly had increased muscle stiffness as an infant, though no formal diagnosis is documented in the information provided.

Her medical history also includes congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong lactose intolerance; since infancy she has had reproducible watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating after exposure to lactose-containing milk or dairy, with symptom resolution when lactose is strictly avoided. As supportive metabolic documentation, prior stool testing during symptomatic periods has shown persistently acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances, consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption in the setting of lactase deficiency.

Parents report that tone remains low but stable over time, with easy fatigability during physical exertion and a tendency to tire sooner than peers. Metabolic history is notable for congenital lactase deficiency, with symptoms beginning in early life: ingestion of lactose-containing foods reliably triggers watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, and increased stool frequency, with improvement on strict lactose avoidance. When exposed, symptoms recur within hours and can lead to reduced oral intake for the remainder of the day. Prior laboratory documentation includes a stool reducing substances test on 2023-06-14 reported as positive, and a lactose hydrogen breath test on 2023-07-02 showing an early rise in breath hydrogen to 48 ppm (baseline 6 ppm) with reproduction of diarrhea and cramping, consistent with persistent lactose malabsorption. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with lifelong lactose intolerance requiring dietary restriction and a paternal cousin with hypotonia noted in infancy."

Neurologic history is otherwise focused on these paroxysmal events without additional defined neurologic diagnoses documented. Metabolic evaluation to date has shown persistent abnormal blood chemistry findings on repeat testing, including mild-to-moderate elevations of serum lactate (2.8–3.6 mmol/L on multiple draws) and intermittent hyperammonemia (peaks around 75–95 µmol/L, with near-normal values between episodes), without a single unifying named metabolic disorder established in the record. These laboratory abnormalities have been noted both during acute episodes and on at least one baseline outpatient check, suggesting partial persistence with episodic worsening. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a childhood-onset seizure disorder and a paternal cousin reported to have recurrent convulsive episodes; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Caregivers report that she has benefited from ongoing supportive therapies but continues to have mild functional limitations with endurance-based activities. She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong lactose intolerance; even small amounts of lactose-containing milk products reliably trigger watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating within hours, leading the family to maintain strict lactose avoidance. When inadvertent exposures occur, symptoms can be significant enough to limit school participation for the remainder of the day, and stools return to baseline with avoidance. Metabolic evaluation is consistent with the known enzyme deficiency, with repeatedly low lactase activity on prior intestinal enzyme testing and no evidence of episodic variation; during symptomatic exposures, stool testing has shown acidic pH (5.0) and positive reducing substances, supporting carbohydrate malabsorption. Family history is significant for a sibling with similar lactose-triggered diarrhea beginning in infancy, and the patient’s mother reports lifelong lactose intolerance as well."

Caregivers report that ingestion of milk or other lactose-containing foods reliably provokes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating within hours, with symptoms resolving when lactose is avoided; he has used lactose-free alternatives at home and school to reduce missed activities. Metabolic monitoring has shown a persistent pattern consistent with lactase deficiency, including repeated stool testing demonstrating acidic stool (pH ~5.0–5.5) with positive reducing substances during symptomatic periods after lactose exposure, and improvement of stool consistency when lactose is eliminated. Neurologic history includes episodes of seizures without a more specific classification available; events have been described as sudden loss of awareness with generalized shaking lasting 1–2 minutes followed by post-event sleepiness, occurring intermittently rather than daily. There is no additional semiology documented to further subtype the seizures. Family history is significant for a paternal aunt with a seizure disorder and a maternal uncle with lifelong lactose intolerance requiring avoidance of dairy; no consanguinity is reported."

Caregivers describe episodic events concerning for seizures, occurring roughly monthly, with sudden behavioral arrest followed by generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting 1–2 minutes, then post-event sleepiness for up to an hour; no focal onset has been consistently observed, and events have interfered with school attendance due to fatigue after episodes.

Caregivers describe symptoms beginning in infancy with watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and excessive gas shortly after ingestion of milk or other lactose-containing foods, with improvement when lactose is strictly avoided. Episodes have been significant enough at times to interfere with appetite and daily activities during symptomatic periods. Metabolic evaluation has been consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption, including repeatedly low lactase activity on intestinal disaccharidase testing and breath hydrogen testing showing a marked rise after lactose challenge (e.g., increase of ~45 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes), supporting a persistent pattern rather than episodic intolerance. Neurologic history includes seizures not further specified; events are described as intermittent convulsive episodes with loss of awareness and post-event sleepiness, without a clearly documented provoking factor. Family history is notable for parental consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. There is also report of a sibling with similar lactose-triggered diarrhea in early childhood and a paternal cousin with a history of recurrent seizures."

Outside of these episodes, baseline neurologic function is reported as stable. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent, nonspecific abnormalities on prior laboratory testing, including recurrent elevations in serum lactate (most recently 3.4–4.1 mmol/L on repeat draws) and mildly increased plasma ammonia (peak 68 µmol/L), with values fluctuating but remaining above reference range on multiple occasions; caregivers report no clear relationship to fasting or intercurrent illness.

Caregivers describe longstanding unsteadiness with gait and posture, with clumsiness that is more apparent during running and stair navigation; she has trouble with balance-dependent tasks such as hopping on one foot and tends to use a widened stance when fatigued. These coordination problems have functional impact in play and school physical activities, with frequent stumbling and difficulty keeping pace with peers, though no additional neurologic diagnoses are documented in the record provided. Metabolic evaluation to date has shown intermittent, nonspecific laboratory abnormalities; for example, prior bloodwork has demonstrated mildly elevated plasma lactate around 3.1 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) with a concurrent anion gap of 18, with subsequent repeat testing returning closer to baseline (lactate 1.7 mmol/L), suggesting episodic rather than persistent elevation. Family history is reported as positive for similar balance and coordination problems in a maternal uncle who required physical therapy in childhood, without other specified neurologic or metabolic diagnoses noted."

Episodes have been characterized by low serum bicarbonate with acidemia on blood gas; during a recent symptomatic period, venous pH was 7.28 with bicarbonate 14 mmol/L and an elevated anion gap of 20, with partial improvement after supportive care and interval recurrence reported on separate occasions, suggesting a relapsing pattern rather than a single isolated event. During these periods she and her family also describe unsteady gait and clumsiness, with difficulty sustaining tandem walking and needing to slow down on stairs; symptoms fluctuate and can interfere with school activities requiring balance and fine motor control. Family history is significant for similar episodes of “acid build-up” requiring emergency evaluation in a maternal uncle, and a sibling with longstanding coordination difficulties affecting sports participation. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives from the same lineage with intermittent balance problems."

Between events he returns to baseline function. Metabolic/laboratory history includes persistent, non-specific abnormalities on prior bloodwork, including repeated mild hyperammonemia (ammonia 78–96 µmol/L on multiple draws) and episodic lactic acid elevation (lactate 3.4–4.1 mmol/L during acute presentations) with otherwise stable basic chemistries, raising concern for a recurring biochemical pattern rather than a single transient result.

Neurologic history is further characterized by generalized weakness rather than focal deficits, without a described pattern of acute episodic paralysis. Metabolic evaluation has shown a chronic biochemical pattern compatible with impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism, including repeatedly elevated venous lactate in the 3.2–4.6 mmol/L range (reference 0.5–2.2) with intermittent mild elevation of pyruvate (0.16–0.22 mmol/L, reference 0.08–0.16), with elevations noted across multiple checks rather than a single isolated result.

Between events, development and baseline function are not further characterized in the available history. Metabolic evaluation during symptomatic periods has demonstrated acid–base disturbance consistent with acidosis, including a venous blood gas showing pH 7.26 with bicarbonate 14 mmol/L and an anion gap of 18, with repeat testing on a separate encounter again showing low bicarbonate (15 mmol/L), suggesting persistence across episodes rather than a single transient finding. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood and recurrent acidosis requiring hospitalization in an older sibling. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports no other specific neurologic diagnoses in close relatives."

Since birth he has had a visible ear malformation, with a small, misshapen pinna on exam, and he also has a structural foot anomaly present from infancy that has affected gait mechanics and shoe fit over time. Physical features are additionally described as dysmorphic, with mild facial asymmetry noted on observation. Developmental history includes a speech and language disorder with persistent difficulty producing age-appropriate expressive language and articulation, impacting classroom communication and requiring ongoing supports. There is no suggestion in the record of a broader neuropsychiatric diagnosis beyond the documented language impairment. Prior genetic evaluation is documented: single-gene testing performed on 2025-10-28 was reported as negative. The combination of congenital ear findings, congenital foot malformation, and dysmorphic features has been followed as part of his known congenital malformation syndrome, with the above functional impacts primarily related to communication and mobility."

Since infancy she has had reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to breast milk/formula or foods containing lactose, described as frequent loose, watery stools with abdominal cramping and gassiness; symptoms improve with strict lactose avoidance and recur within hours of accidental ingestion, with particular sensitivity to dairy and lactose-containing medications. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently low small-intestinal lactase activity on prior evaluation, and supportive stool studies during symptomatic periods have demonstrated acidic stool pH around 5.0 with positive reducing substances, consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption during lactose exposure. Neurologic history is notable for ataxia with an unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, leading to frequent tripping and difficulty with stairs and playground balance activities; symptoms are present daily and more apparent with fatigue. Family history is significant for similar lactose intolerance in a sibling and a paternal aunt. The parents are first cousins, and there is no reported family history of progressive neuromuscular disease."

Developmentally, he has required ongoing support for learning and adaptive functioning consistent with moderate intellectual impairment, with delays impacting communication and age-expected problem solving. Neurologic history is significant for the known callosal agenesis without additional neurologic diagnosis stated here. On physical exam, dysmorphic features include a small, malformed external ear consistent with microtia and subtle craniofacial asymmetry. Congenital gastrointestinal history includes the known esophageal atresia, with ongoing need for careful feeding history and monitoring for swallowing tolerance as documented in prior records. Prior genetic evaluation included chromosomal microarray performed on 2026-01-21, which was negative.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories include a recent accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, recorded as an initial encounter for poisoning by penicillins. He also had an initial encounter for a scalp laceration without foreign body and an initial encounter for concussion without loss of consciousness, with injury details recorded in the acute-care documentation."

Neurologic history includes epilepsy characterized by generalized seizures that are not intractable, with recurrent convulsive events reported over time and post-event confusion; episodes have functional impact through activity restrictions and need for supervision around water and heights. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle (generalized convulsions beginning in adolescence) and lactose intolerance in the patient’s father with similar post-dairy diarrhea and bloating; parents deny consanguinity.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories include a recent superficial burn involving the head/face/neck region without a specified burn degree, and a scalp laceration without foreign body, both described as acute injuries requiring local wound care."

Family history is contributory: the patient’s parents are first cousins. A maternal uncle is reported to have longstanding gait unsteadiness described as “poor balance,” and a paternal aunt has a history of recurrent unexplained abnormal blood test results per family report, without a named diagnosis recorded.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent superficial burn of the head/face/neck without specified degree, managed as an acute injury. She also has a documented concussion without loss of consciousness after a head impact, with acute symptoms recorded at the time of injury.

Prior laboratory data available in the chart include venous chemistry showing bicarbonate 14–16 mmol/L with an anion gap of 18–20 and venous pH around 7.28 during symptomatic periods, with interval improvement to bicarbonate ~20 mmol/L when well. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. There is also a family history of similar early hypotonia in an older sibling and a paternal cousin who has had repeated hospitalizations for episodes described as “acid buildup” requiring IV fluids, without further diagnostic detail provided in current records.  \n\nSecondary medical issues include an acute accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, documented as an unintentional ingestion/overdose event, as well as a superficial burn involving an unspecified degree of burn to the head/face/neck region. She also has a history of a right ankle sprain involving unspecified ligament, treated as an acute injury."

Laboratory history is notable for an “other specified abnormal finding of blood chemistry,” with documented episodic hyperammonemia on prior evaluations (ammonia 92–118 µmol/L; reference <50) and mild, persistent elevation of lactate (2.8–3.4 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2), without a single unifying diagnosis stated in the record. Abnormal chemistries have been noted on more than one draw, including during periods of clinical stability, suggesting they are not purely transient. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in childhood and a paternal cousin with recurrent seizures; no parental consanguinity is reported.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a right ankle sprain with injury to the ankle ligaments from an acute event, with localized pain and swelling at the time of injury. History also includes an accidental penicillin exposure resulting in an adverse drug event documented as unintentional, without additional characterization in the available record."

She also has a documented acid-base disturbance characterized by recurrent metabolic acidosis. Available laboratory data show episodic low serum bicarbonate in the mid-teens (e.g., 15–17 mmol/L) with corresponding low venous pH around 7.28–7.32, with partial improvement between episodes but a tendency to recur during intercurrent illness. Symptoms during these episodes have included increased fatigue and reduced activity tolerance. Family history is significant for consanguinity; the parents are first cousins. There is also report of a similarly affected paternal cousin with a history of neonatal low tone and recurrent “acid problems” requiring hospital evaluations in early childhood. No prior genetic testing results were provided in the chart for review at this visit.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent scalp laceration treated as an initial encounter, without reported loss of consciousness, and a superficial burn of unspecified degree and site managed as an initial encounter, with no complications described in the available record."

He also carries a diagnosis of a congenital malformation syndrome predominantly affecting facial appearance, and on exam today he has mild dysmorphic features with a small, atypically formed external ear and subtle facial asymmetry at rest. Developmentally, there is a speech and language disorder not otherwise specified, with delayed expressive language and reduced intelligibility compared with peers, impacting communication at preschool and requiring frequent repetition and caregiver interpretation. No other specific neurologic diagnoses are documented in the provided history. Prior testing includes a gene panel performed on 2025-09-21, reported as negative.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories include a recent scalp laceration, an episode of concussion without loss of consciousness, and a documented accidental poisoning by a penicillin-class antibiotic. These were treated as acute events; current visit documentation focuses on the congenital craniofacial findings and speech/language development."

Since infancy he has demonstrated low muscle tone with “floppiness” described by caregivers, with delayed acquisition of head control and early gross motor milestones; tone has remained low compared with peers, contributing to easy fatigability with prolonged play and reduced endurance for age-typical activities. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels on multiple checks, with representative values of 780–920 µmol/L (reference 30–120 µmol/L) and relatively normal tyrosine around 55 µmol/L (reference 35–110 µmol/L), consistent with a chronic pattern rather than episodic spikes. Caregivers report sensitivity to dietary protein intake, with higher phenylalanine values noted after periods of increased natural protein exposure. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a diagnosed phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring lifelong dietary management, and the parents are first cousins. No prior genetic test results were provided in the record for review.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories include a recent accidental ingestion of a penicillin-class antibiotic, treated as an acute exposure without noted complications, and a scalp laceration that was evaluated and managed as an acute injury."

Laboratory history also documents an “other specified abnormal finding of blood chemistry,” with repeat metabolic panels showing persistently elevated serum lactate around 3.0–3.6 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and intermittent mild hyperammonemia to ~65–78 µmol/L (ref 11–35), without clear acute illness triggers at the times drawn. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in adolescence and a maternal cousin with recurrent generalized seizures; parents deny consanguinity. Prior testing includes a blood chemistry evaluation dated 2025-10-14 confirming the above elevations on repeat sampling.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent scalp laceration treated as an initial encounter after a fall, with no reported complications, and an initial encounter for an unspecified degree burn of the head/face/neck region described as superficial, managed conservatively per family report."

    "clinical_note": "Bridget Keaton is an 11-year-old female with history notable for congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong intolerance to lactose-containing foods. Caregivers describe reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after dairy exposure, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools, with improvement when lactose is avoided; symptoms recur with accidental ingestion, suggesting a persistent dietary sensitivity rather than isolated episodes. Neurologically, she has documented ataxia characterized by unsteady gait and impaired coordination, with difficulty running and climbing stairs and occasional stumbling noted during routine activities. No additional neurologic syndrome is inferred beyond the observed coordination deficit. Family history is significant for lactose intolerance consistent with lactase deficiency in her father and a paternal aunt; there is also parental consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. Prior testing includes a hydrogen breath test dated 2023-08-10 that showed an early rise in breath hydrogen to 48 ppm above baseline after lactose challenge, supporting lactase deficiency; during symptomatic periods, stool pH has been recorded at 5.0 with positive reducing substances.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent superficial burn of the head/face/neck without specified depth, a concussion without loss of consciousness after a minor head injury, and an accidental ingestion/overdose of a systemic antibiotic, all described as acute events without further chronic sequelae documented in this encounter."

Neurodevelopmental history includes specific developmental disorder of motor function, with longstanding fine and gross motor coordination difficulties affecting handwriting, dressing tasks, and participation in age-typical sports. He is also followed for a congenital malformation syndrome affecting multiple systems; on exam he has mild dysmorphic features including a flat nasal bridge and low-set ears. Family history is reported as contributory for congenital anomalies, including a maternal uncle with a similar eyelid droop and a paternal cousin who had a congenital esophageal anomaly in infancy; no consanguinity is reported. Prior genetic evaluation includes a gene panel performed on 2025-12-14, which was negative.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent concussion without loss of consciousness, with transient headache and light sensitivity reported after the event. He also sustained a right ankle sprain, described as swelling and pain with weight-bearing. Additionally, there is a documented accidental poisoning by a penicillin-class antibiotic, with an acute medication ingestion error noted in the record."

She also carries a history of metabolic acidosis with documented low serum bicarbonate on repeated checks; prior episodes have shown bicarbonate 15–17 mmol/L with a normal anion gap and compensatory tachypnea during illness, improving with correction but recurring intermittently. Family history is significant for similar episodic unsteadiness in a paternal uncle and recurrent “low bicarbonate” evaluations in a maternal aunt. The parents are first cousins, and there is no reported adoption or donor gametes. Prior testing includes a basic metabolic panel dated 2025-11-03 demonstrating CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16 mmol/L with chloride 112 mmol/L, consistent with ongoing metabolic acidosis at that time.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent mild concussion without loss of consciousness, along with an acute right ankle sprain that temporarily worsened balance. She also sustained a scalp laceration requiring acute care, without reported neurologic deficit from the wound itself."

Neurologically, she has truncal unsteadiness and a wide-based gait consistent with ataxia, with frequent stumbling on uneven surfaces and difficulty with tandem walking; symptoms are present daily and affect playground activities and stair navigation. No seizures are described in the available history. Family history is significant for an older brother with a similar lifelong unsteady gait and need for school-based motor supports, and a maternal uncle reported to have chronic balance problems beginning in childhood.

Available records describe chronically elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, typically in the 480–720 µmol/L range on serial monitoring, with relative stability over time rather than episodic spikes; tyrosine has been low-normal (e.g., ~45–55 µmol/L). Clinically, she is also followed for generalized epilepsy with intractable seizures without status epilepticus, characterized by recurrent generalized seizure events that continue despite ongoing antiseizure therapy per caregiver report, with functional impact including activity restrictions and need for close supervision. Family history is significant for similar metabolic findings and seizure disorder in relatives; the patient’s parents are first cousins.

Between episodes, endurance is limited compared with peers, with early fatigue during play. Metabolic monitoring has shown a persistent pattern of elevated lactate, including a venous lactate of 3.8–4.6 mmol/L on repeat checks, with intermittent lactate/pyruvate ratio elevation (e.g., 28 on one draw), supporting ongoing mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction rather than a single transient abnormality. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures and exercise intolerance, and the parents report they are first cousins. Prior testing includes a metabolic evaluation dated 2024-08-12, reported as consistent with mitochondrial metabolism dysfunction.\n\nSecondary medical issues include an acute accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic with associated adverse effect prompting evaluation, without further details available in this record. He also has a recent scalp laceration that was described as open, requiring acute care at the time of injury."

Parents report episodic worsening of balance when dietary protein intake is higher, with more frequent tripping and difficulty maintaining a steady, narrow-based gait; symptoms are most evident with running and stairs and have impacted participation in age-typical sports. Neurologic exam is described as consistent with ataxia, with unsteady tandem gait and poor coordination on rapid alternating movements. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, for example 980 µmol/L on recent testing with prior values commonly in the 700–1100 µmol/L range, while tyrosine has been low-normal (e.g., 35 µmol/L), consistent with dietary sensitivity and chronic elevation rather than a single transient spike. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a similar phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring dietary restriction and a maternal cousin with chronic balance problems. The parents are first cousins. Prior genetic testing (molecular panel for phenylalanine metabolism disorders) dated 2023-06-14 reported a pathogenic variant consistent with the known metabolic diagnosis.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent scalp laceration requiring repair after a fall, without reported loss of consciousness, and a prior accidental ingestion of a penicillin-class antibiotic with transient gastrointestinal upset; no additional systemic complications were documented from that exposure."

Metabolic evaluation has been pursued for “other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry,” with persistent mild hyperammonemia on repeat testing (ammonia 78–92 µmol/L; reference <50) and episodic lactic acid elevation during intercurrent illness (lactate up to 3.6 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2), without a single named inborn error recorded in the chart. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and there is also report of a paternal cousin with recurrent seizures. Prior testing includes a plasma ammonia and lactate panel dated 2025-11-14 demonstrating ammonia 86 µmol/L and lactate 2.1 mmol/L, summarized as abnormal blood chemistry findings.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a right ankle sprain without fracture after an acute twisting injury, treated as an initial encounter; an accidental ingestion of a penicillin-class antibiotic with subsequent evaluation for adverse effect; and an initial encounter scalp laceration without foreign body requiring wound care after minor head trauma."

Neurodevelopmental history includes specific developmental disorder of motor function, described as longstanding fine- and gross-motor coordination difficulty with functional impact on handwriting, dressing tasks, and sports participation. He also carries a diagnosis consistent with a congenital malformation syndrome predominantly affecting facial appearance; on exam today he has subtle dysmorphic features including a broad nasal bridge and mildly low-set ears. No additional syndromic features are detailed in the available record beyond these facial findings and the above congenital anomalies. Prior genetic testing is documented: chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-10-20 was negative. Overall, the encounter documentation focuses on the combination of congenital cardiac findings, motor coordination impairment affecting daily activities, and mild facial dysmorphism in the setting of a defined congenital malformation syndrome.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories include a recent concussion without loss of consciousness, a superficial burn of unspecified degree/site, and an open scalp wound, each described as an acute injury history without further complication details available in the current note."

Caregivers describe intermittent events characterized by abrupt loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting about 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and headache; events have occurred a few times per year, with occasional clustering during intercurrent febrile illness. Between episodes she returns to baseline function. Metabolic evaluation has shown a persistent pattern consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including chronically elevated plasma lactate (typically 3.8–5.2 mmol/L; ref 0.5–2.2) with elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratios around 28–32, and episodic mild metabolic acidosis during illness (serum bicarbonate 16–18 mmol/L) that resolves with recovery. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in childhood and a maternal grandmother reported to have a mitochondrial metabolic condition with exercise intolerance. Parents deny consanguinity.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent accidental ingestion/overdose of a penicillin-class antibiotic requiring acute evaluation, without ongoing sequelae described. She also sustained a right ankle sprain with ligamentous injury after a twist, with pain and swelling limiting running for several days and improving with rest and support."

Records describe low muscle tone in the newborn period with poor spontaneous movement and diminished antigravity strength, requiring close feeding and developmental monitoring early in life. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent hypertyrosinemia, with plasma tyrosine repeatedly elevated (e.g., 620–780 µmol/L; reference 35–110) on serial checks rather than a single episodic spike; phenylalanine has been within the expected range on available reports. Clinical documentation links the biochemical pattern to dietary sensitivity, with higher tyrosine values noted during periods of increased protein intake. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins, and there is a history of a similarly affected paternal cousin with elevated tyrosine on newborn screening and early hypotonia. Prior testing includes a plasma amino acids panel performed on 2020-06-18 demonstrating markedly elevated tyrosine with otherwise non-diagnostic amino acid profile.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a scalp laceration treated as an initial encounter, a documented accidental penicillin exposure consistent with poisoning by penicillins as an initial encounter, and a right ankle sprain involving an unspecified ligament during an initial encounter, managed as an acute injury without further detail in the available record."

    "clinical_note": "Ivy Vaughn is a 5-year-old female with history notable for congenital lactase deficiency with dietary sensitivity since infancy. Caregivers describe consistent gastrointestinal intolerance to lactose-containing feeds, with episodes of watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and irritability after dairy exposure; symptoms improve when lactose is avoided and recur reliably with reintroduction. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently low lactase activity on prior workup with supportive stool studies, including acidic stool pH around 5.0 and intermittent positive reducing substances during symptomatic periods. Neurologic history is notable for lack of coordination, described as clumsiness with an unsteady gait and frequent stumbling compared with peers, affecting running and stair navigation; no specific neurologic diagnosis is documented beyond the observed ataxic features. Family history is significant for a sibling with congenital lactase deficiency requiring lifelong lactose restriction. The parents are first cousins, and there is additional reported family history of similar dairy intolerance in a paternal aunt. Prior testing includes a lactose tolerance evaluation dated 2023-06-14, reported as consistent with lactase deficiency.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent accidental penicillin exposure resulting in poisoning by penicillins (unintentional), as well as an open scalp laceration without foreign body and a superficial burn of unspecified degree involving the hand/wrist region, all documented as initial encounters."

Neurodevelopmental history is significant for developmental delay/intellectual disability with a prominent speech and language delay; communication deficits have impacted day-to-day functioning and require ongoing support for expressive and receptive language. He also carries a diagnosis consistent with a congenital malformation syndrome affecting multiple systems; on exam he has mild dysmorphic features, including low-set ears and a broad nasal bridge. Family history is not documented as contributory in the available record. Prior genetic testing included a gene panel performed on 2026-01-20, which was reported as negative.\n\nSecondary medical issues include an acute right ankle sprain, described as a sprain of an unspecified ligament, with pain and swelling after injury.

History is consistent with a recent mechanical impact to the head followed by concussion-type symptoms such as headache and feeling “dazed,” with attention and short-term memory briefly affected, but without a documented period of blackout. The scalp wound is described as an open laceration with bleeding at the time of injury, requiring wound care and monitoring for local complications. The encounter is also notable for an accidental exposure/ingestion of a penicillin-class antibiotic, recorded as an unintentional medication poisoning event; symptoms at the time of exposure are not further characterized in the available data, and the timing is treated as part of the same acute episode. Functional impact is primarily related to post-injury symptoms and recovery after the head trauma, with need for observation for worsening neurologic symptoms and for any delayed effects related to the medication exposure."

History is notable for a concussion without loss of consciousness, with post-injury symptoms including headache and dizziness and difficulty concentrating reported since the incident, impacting schoolwork and screen tolerance. She also had an accidental exposure to a systemic antibiotic, described as an unintentional ingestion/administration error; following the exposure she developed acute gastrointestinal upset with nausea and loose stools but remained awake and interactive, without reported loss of consciousness. Additionally, she sustained a burn involving the face, described as a superficial burn with erythema and tenderness and no visible blistering, affecting comfort with washing and sun exposure. The timing of these events is described as recent and related to the current encounter; no chronic neurologic diagnosis is stated beyond the concussion, and burn severity is limited to superficial skin involvement as observed. No family history or prior genetic testing information is available in the provided record for this visit."

    "clinical_note": "Callum Fairmont is a 15-year-old male seen following an acute right ankle injury consistent with a sprain of the right ankle. History describes a recent twisting mechanism with immediate lateral ankle pain and swelling, with difficulty bearing weight and reduced range of motion due to pain; symptoms have limited sports participation and prolonged walking since the event. Examination is consistent with soft-tissue injury at the ankle, with focal tenderness and edema around the lateral malleolar region and pain with inversion/plantarflexion maneuvers, without reported open wound. The encounter is also notable for an accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, described as an unintentional ingestion/administration error. After the exposure, he developed acute medication-related symptoms requiring medical attention; documentation focuses on the accidental nature of the event rather than a planned therapeutic course. No additional chronic conditions are described within the available record, and the visit narrative centers on the ankle sprain management context and the associated accidental antibiotic exposure."

She also has a scalp laceration with active oozing at onset that has since slowed, leaving a visibly open linear wound with surrounding swelling and dried blood in the hair. Caregivers report the scalp wound was noticed immediately after the incident and required prompt cleansing and pressure to control bleeding; since then, she has been more irritable and avoids having her hair or scalp handled due to discomfort. On exam today, the scalp injury remains open with mild edema at the margins and no gross contamination noted, and the burn area shows erythema and tenderness consistent with an acute burn to the head/face/neck region.

History is notable for a recent superficial burn involving the head and face, described as erythema and tenderness without reported blistering or charring, with discomfort during washing and when exposed to warm water. Caregivers report the burn was sustained in a household incident, and since then he has been more irritable during facial cleansing but is otherwise able to eat and drink normally. He is also evaluated for a right ankle sprain following a twisting injury, with lateral ankle pain, mild swelling, and reluctance to bear full weight; symptoms are worse with walking and improve with rest. No deformity is described, and he can move the toes though ankle motion is limited by pain. There is no family history data provided in this record, and no prior diagnostic testing information is available for review."

She also sustained a right ankle sprain involving unspecified ligaments, with lateral ankle pain and swelling and difficulty bearing weight immediately after the injury, now limiting running and sports participation. The encounter is further notable for an accidental exposure to a systemic antibiotic in the penicillin class; shortly after the unintended ingestion/administration, she developed acute medication-related symptoms prompting medical evaluation, without documentation here of an intentional overdose. No additional chronic neurologic disorder is described beyond the observed post-concussive symptoms, and the ankle findings remain consistent with an acute sprain rather than a fracture.

History is consistent with a concussion without loss of consciousness, with symptoms beginning after the inciting event and including headache and transient dizziness, with slowed concentration noted during routine tasks. She has remained awake and interactive since the injury, and there has been no reported episode of syncope. Examination documents a scalp laceration with localized tenderness and mild swelling; bleeding was controlled prior to evaluation. The wound edges are described as linear and superficial-appearing, without signs of deep tissue involvement, and surrounding skin shows no spreading erythema. Neurologic screening in clinic is notable for intact orientation and speech, though she appears mildly uncomfortable due to head pain. Symptoms have impacted school participation today due to difficulty focusing and sensitivity to routine activity.

    "clinical_note": "Beckett Conrad is a 3-year-old male seen after a recent head injury consistent with a concussion without loss of consciousness. History describes an acute event followed by symptoms such as headache and transient dizziness with sensitivity to light and noise, leading to reduced play tolerance and need for more rest than usual; no loss of consciousness is reported. Caregivers note intermittent nausea and irritability since the injury, with symptoms waxing and waning over the first day and prompting medical evaluation. The encounter is also notable for an accidental ingestion/exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, described as an unintentional event requiring assessment for medication toxicity; details suggest a single acute exposure rather than a chronic medication issue. At the time of evaluation, there is no indication of intentional self-harm. No prior genetic or specialty testing information is available in the record for this visit, and family history details are not provided."

He also has an acute concussion without loss of consciousness. Since the event, he reports headache and feeling “foggy,” with slowed concentration and increased fatigue compared with baseline; symptoms have been continuous since the injury rather than episodic. He denies any history of passing out at the time of injury, and there is no documentation of prolonged confusion. Neurologic observation in clinic is consistent with a mild traumatic brain injury: he is awake, conversant, and oriented, though he is noticeably slower to respond and prefers a quiet room due to head discomfort.

History is also notable for an accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, taken in a manner consistent with unintentional ingestion or dosing error. After the exposure, he developed symptoms consistent with an acute medication-related toxic effect, including gastrointestinal upset with nausea and vomiting and transient lethargy, without any description here of a rash, wheezing, or other features that would suggest an allergic reaction. Caregivers report the medication was not intended to be taken in that amount, and the episode was managed as an acute ingestion event.

Clinical records also document metabolic derangement characterized by acidosis, with chemistry panels during acute episodes showing low serum bicarbonate around 14–16 mmol/L with an elevated anion gap near 20–22 and venous blood gas pH approximately 7.26–7.30, with partial improvement on repeat testing to bicarbonate ~20 mmol/L when clinically stable, suggesting an episodic pattern rather than a continuously low baseline. No additional seizure semiology is specified beyond the observed convulsive episodes and postictal period. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with a history of recurrent seizures beginning in adolescence and a paternal cousin reported to have “acid problems” requiring hospital evaluation for low blood pH during childhood; parents deny known consanguinity."

Caregivers report reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to lactose-containing foods, including watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping, with improvement on strict lactose avoidance and use of lactose-free alternatives. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently low lactase activity on prior stool enzyme analysis with normal fecal fat, and episodic dehydration during more severe diarrheal episodes. Neurologic history is notable for ataxia with an unsteady, wide-based gait and impaired coordination, described as frequent stumbling and difficulty with tandem walking that interferes with running and playground activities; symptoms are present on most days and are more apparent when fatigued. Family history is significant for similar lactose-related symptoms in a paternal aunt and longstanding gait unsteadiness in a maternal uncle. The parents are first cousins, and there is no other pedigree detail available in the record."

She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with symptoms beginning in early childhood: ingestion of lactose-containing foods reliably triggers watery diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain within a few hours, with episodic bloating; symptoms improve with strict lactose avoidance and recur with accidental exposures. Recent dietary challenge documented recurrence of symptoms after a single serving of milk. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently low lactase activity consistent with the diagnosis, and stool testing during symptomatic periods has demonstrated acidic stool with reducing substances present; hydration has remained adequate without reported hospitalizations. Family history is significant for a sibling with similar lactose-triggered diarrhea and a maternal aunt with lifelong intolerance to dairy products. There is also a report of a paternal cousin described as having low muscle tone in infancy requiring physical therapy."

Caregivers describe predictable gastrointestinal intolerance after ingestion of lactose-containing foods, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools, with improvement when lactose is avoided; symptoms are described as reproducible rather than episodic and have affected dietary choices at school and home. He also carries a diagnosis of other generalized epilepsy without status epilepticus, characterized by recurrent generalized seizures; events have been reported as brief with postictal sleepiness, without a history of prolonged convulsive episodes requiring emergent treatment for status epilepticus. Metabolic monitoring has included targeted carbohydrate-related testing, with repeated stool acidity testing showing low pH (approximately 5.0–5.5) during symptomatic periods and breath hydrogen testing demonstrating marked rises after lactose challenge (increase ~40–60 ppm), consistent with persistent lactose malabsorption rather than transient intolerance. Family history is significant for similar lifelong lactose intolerance in the father and generalized seizure disorder in a paternal uncle. The parents are first cousins."

Neurologic history is notable for episodes of seizure-like activity without a specified syndrome; events have been intermittent, described as sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting roughly 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event fatigue and confusion for up to an hour. No consistent trigger has been identified. Metabolic evaluation has included persistently low lactase activity consistent with her congenital enzyme deficiency; recent dietary challenge documentation notes recurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of approximately 10–12 g lactose. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with recurrent seizures beginning in adolescence and a younger brother with similar lactose intolerance symptoms since infancy."

Caregivers describe persistent motor coordination difficulties affecting age-expected gross and fine motor tasks, with delayed acquisition of complex movements and frequent clumsiness that interferes with play and self-care skills. Physical examination history is also notable for dysmorphic features including a small external ear (microtia) and congenital foot malformation consistent with a deformity present since birth, contributing to altered foot shape and gait mechanics. Overall findings are consistent with a congenital malformation syndrome involving multiple systems, as reflected by the combination of craniofacial, central nervous system, and limb anomalies.

Tone has remained low over time with functional impact on gross motor endurance and prolonged time to achieve age-expected motor skills, without description of episodic weakness. Medical history also includes congenital lactase deficiency with symptoms beginning in early feeding: ingestion of lactose-containing formula or dairy has reliably triggered watery diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and increased gassiness, with improvement when lactose is avoided. Metabolic evaluation has shown a consistent pattern compatible with lactase deficiency, including acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances during symptomatic periods and symptom resolution on lactose-free intake; no other analytes are reported as persistently abnormal. Family history is notable for an older sibling with similar early-onset lactose intolerance requiring lactose restriction, and a maternal uncle reported to have lifelong dairy-triggered diarrhea. No consanguinity is reported."

Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, with a recent value of 980 µmol/L (reference 30–120) and prior values commonly in the 700–1100 µmol/L range, consistent with a chronic pattern rather than episodic spikes; tyrosine has been relatively low-normal at 35 µmol/L (reference 40–90). Clinically, he has longstanding low axial tone, described as reduced trunk strength and “floppiness” since infancy, with functional impact including easy fatigability with prolonged sitting and slower gross-motor endurance compared with peers. Neurologic exam history is characterized by diminished postural stability without a focal lateralizing pattern. Family history is significant for an affected sibling with a similar phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring ongoing biochemical surveillance, and a maternal uncle reported to have had hypotonia in early childhood. Parents deny consanguinity."

Since infancy he has had low axial tone with “floppiness” noted in the newborn period, with delayed acquisition of head control and early gross-motor milestones; family reports he fatigues with prolonged activity and benefits from frequent breaks, though he remains ambulatory. Metabolic history is consistent with persistent hyperphenylalaninemia, with representative prior plasma amino acids showing phenylalanine 780 µmol/L (ref 30–120) on one draw and 640 µmol/L on repeat testing, with tyrosine 38 µmol/L (ref 35–110), suggesting a chronic pattern rather than episodic elevation; family reports dietary sensitivity with higher values when protein intake increases. There is a positive family history of a similar phenylalanine metabolism disorder in an older sibling requiring dietary management. Parents report consanguinity, stating they are first cousins."

Caregivers describe intermittent events characterized by sudden behavioral arrest with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking lasting about 1–2 minutes, followed by several minutes of sleepiness and confusion; episodes have occurred both with and without fever and have led to missed preschool days and activity restrictions due to safety concerns. No single precipitant is consistently identified. Metabolic history includes lactose intolerance with reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after dairy exposure; family reports abdominal cramping, bloating, and loose stools within a few hours of milk or ice cream, improving with avoidance and use of lactose-free products. Recent supportive testing showed a lactose hydrogen breath test with a rise in breath hydrogen from 8 ppm at baseline to 52 ppm at 90 minutes, consistent with lactose malabsorption, and symptoms have been persistent with dietary sensitivity rather than episodic. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood; there is no reported parental consanguinity."

Metabolic evaluation has shown a persistent pattern consistent with impaired energy metabolism, including chronically elevated plasma lactate around 3.8–4.6 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (approximately 28–32), and intermittent mild elevation of alanine on plasma amino acids; values have remained abnormal on repeat checks rather than being isolated findings.

Caregivers report that ingestion of milk, ice cream, or other dairy reliably triggers gastrointestinal symptoms within a few hours, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools; symptoms improve with strict avoidance and recur with accidental exposures, suggesting a persistent pattern rather than isolated episodes. Because of the dietary restriction, the family has periodically monitored carbohydrate-related metabolic markers; recent testing has shown episodic elevations in stool reducing substances (2+ on symptomatic days) with otherwise stable basic metabolic panel values, consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption during exposures. Neurologically, he has chronic gait and coordination difficulty described as unsteadiness when walking, frequent tripping on uneven ground, and impaired balance with tandem gait; fine motor tasks are slower than peers, affecting handwriting and sports participation. Family history is significant for a sibling with similar lifelong lactose-triggered diarrhea and abdominal cramping, and a maternal uncle described as having longstanding problems with balance and coordination."

On exam, coordination is impaired with an ataxic gait pattern, without describing a specific cerebellar syndrome beyond observed unsteadiness. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent elevation of venous lactate, most recently 3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) with an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 28 (ref 10–20), and intermittent mild alanine elevation (564 µmol/L, ref 200–500), supporting a chronic metabolic pattern rather than an isolated episode. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity; the parents are first cousins. A maternal uncle is reported to have a similar lifelong unsteady gait and exercise intolerance, and a paternal cousin has a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolism disorder with episodic fatigue and poor stamina."

Clinical documentation also notes other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry. Available laboratory data are consistent with persistent mild transaminitis, with ALT typically 85–110 U/L and AST 60–80 U/L on repeat testing over several months, while total bilirubin remains within reference range; these abnormalities have been described as ongoing rather than episodic. Family history is significant for seizures in a first-degree relative, with the patient’s father reported to have had generalized seizures beginning in adolescence. A maternal uncle is also reported to have a seizure disorder treated in adulthood. No consanguinity is reported. The combination of recurrent generalized seizures and chronically elevated liver enzymes has prompted continued neurology and medical follow-up, with attention to seizure frequency, recovery time after events, and the persistence of the blood chemistry findings over time."

Neurologic examination history is consistent with decreased truncal tone and reduced antigravity strength without a fixed contracture pattern. Metabolic monitoring has shown a recurring pattern of elevated lactate with intermittent exacerbations during intercurrent illness, including venous lactate values typically in the 3.2–4.8 mmol/L range at baseline and rising to ~6.1 mmol/L during febrile episodes, with mild metabolic acidosis at those times (bicarbonate ~18–20 mmol/L).

Metabolic monitoring has shown elevations consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including persistently increased plasma lactate around 3.2–4.1 mmol/L (reference <2.0) with an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (approximately 28–32), and intermittent mild elevation of alanine on plasma amino acids; abnormalities have been noted on more than one draw rather than a single isolated result. There is a positive family history: a maternal uncle is reported to have a similar longstanding gait unsteadiness, and a maternal grandmother has a history described as a “mitochondrial disorder” with exercise intolerance. Parents deny consanguinity."

He also carries a documented history of metabolic acidosis. Available laboratory data are consistent with persistent low serum bicarbonate, with multiple basic metabolic panels showing bicarbonate 14–18 mmol/L and a corresponding low CO₂, along with mild compensatory hyperventilation noted during episodes of worsening acidosis; anion gap has been variably elevated (e.g., 16–20) depending on the sampling period. These abnormalities have been described as recurrent rather than isolated, with symptomatic periods associated with fatigue and decreased activity tolerance. Family history is notable for similarly affected relatives, including a paternal uncle reported to have had significant low muscle tone in infancy and recurrent episodes of acid–base disturbance requiring medical evaluation. The parents are first cousins, and there is no other family history provided beyond the above metabolic and tone-related findings."

Seizure episodes have been described as recurrent generalized events with postictal fatigue, occurring intermittently and impacting daily functioning due to the need for supervision during activities and recovery time afterward. Her metabolic condition has been followed with clinically interpretable biochemical monitoring; recent evaluations have shown persistently elevated venous lactate around 3.8–4.6 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) with episodic worsening during intercurrent illness, and an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (approximately 28 on one prior draw), supporting ongoing concern for impaired oxidative metabolism. Symptoms consistent with metabolic decompensation have included reduced exercise tolerance and easy fatigability during periods of physiologic stress, without implying a specific syndrome beyond the documented mitochondrial disorder. Family history is significant for a maternal aunt with a seizure disorder beginning in childhood and a maternal cousin reported to have a mitochondrial metabolism condition; parents deny consanguinity."

He also carries a history of acidosis with documented metabolic derangements on prior evaluations. Available laboratory data are consistent with persistent low serum bicarbonate in the high teens (typically 16–19 mmol/L) with a corresponding mild acidemia on venous blood gas (pH ~7.30–7.33) and compensatory low pCO₂; these findings have been noted on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated episode. No additional symptom complexes are described beyond the hypotonia and acid–base disturbance. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. Relatives are described as having similar early-life low muscle tone in at least one sibling/cousin, though details regarding severity and course are limited in the current history."

Metabolic monitoring has shown a persistent pattern consistent with malabsorption during dietary lapses, including episodic low stool pH (5.0–5.5) and positive stool reducing substances, with otherwise stable basic metabolic panels when well hydrated. Neurologic history is notable for recurrent seizures not further characterized in available records; events are described by caregivers as sudden episodes of generalized stiffening with rhythmic shaking lasting about 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness, occurring a few times per year without a consistent trigger. There is a positive family history of similar lactose intolerance in the mother and a maternal uncle, and seizures in a paternal cousin during childhood. Parents deny consanguinity."

Craniofacial shape differences are reported, including a flatter posterior skull contour consistent with brachycephaly, and the exam is notable for mild dysmorphic features with subtle facial asymmetry and a short palpebral fissure appearance. Overall presentation is within the scope of a congenital malformation syndrome involving multiple systems, with neurodevelopmental involvement and the above craniofacial and limb findings noted across childhood. Prior genetic testing is documented: chromosomal microarray (CMA) performed on 2025-12-26 was negative."

No seizures are described in the available history. Metabolic evaluation has been pursued due to persistent, nonspecific abnormal blood chemistry findings on prior laboratory testing; most recently, chemistry panels have repeatedly shown mildly elevated serum lactate (typically 3.0–3.6 mmol/L, ref <2.0) with intermittent elevation of alanine (about 520–610 µmol/L, ref <450), without a clear episodic pattern reported. These laboratory findings have been noted on more than one draw rather than being a single isolated result. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle who reportedly had low muscle tone as an infant and ongoing motor coordination difficulties, and a paternal cousin with a history of neonatal “floppiness” requiring early therapy; there is no known parental consanguinity reported."

Events are described as sudden spells with loss of awareness and generalized stiffening followed by post-event sleepiness, occurring intermittently rather than daily and disrupting school participation on days they occur. There is also a documented pattern of other specified abnormal laboratory findings with persistent metabolic-type abnormalities on prior bloodwork; representative results include repeatedly elevated plasma lactate around 3.8–4.6 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) with episodic anion gap elevation (up to 18–20) during intercurrent illness, and mildly increased serum ammonia approximately 70–85 µmol/L (reference <50) that has not been consistently present on every draw. No single named metabolic disorder is recorded, but the lab pattern has prompted ongoing monitoring. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports a paternal cousin with similar episodic seizure-like spells."

There is no specific seizure syndrome defined in the available record, and the clinical picture is documented as unspecified convulsions. Metabolic history is notable for lactose intolerance with reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after dairy exposure, including crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools; symptoms improve with lactose avoidance and recur with inadvertent intake. Prior laboratory evaluation during symptomatic periods has shown low lactose tolerance testing response with a rise in breath hydrogen to 42 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes, consistent with lactose malabsorption, described as persistent with dietary sensitivity. Family history includes a maternal uncle with childhood-onset convulsions and a paternal cousin with recurrent convulsive episodes; no consanguinity is reported."

Neurologically, she has recurrent generalized seizure events with postictal fatigue, occurring intermittently rather than in prolonged clusters, and there is no history of convulsive activity lasting long enough to meet criteria for status epilepticus.

Records describe esophageal atresia identified in infancy, requiring early surgical management and ongoing feeding and swallowing vulnerability, with intermittent difficulty advancing textures. Ophthalmologic history includes congenital eyelid malformation consistent with blepharophimosis, with a persistently narrow palpebral fissure and reduced eyelid opening on exam. Renal history is significant for congenital polycystic kidney disease, followed longitudinally for enlarged, cystic kidneys and risk of reduced renal concentrating ability; no acute decompensation is documented in today’s referral materials. Neurodevelopmentally, she carries severe intellectual disability with substantial limitations in adaptive functioning, requiring high levels of support for communication, learning, and daily self-care. Dysmorphic features noted include a short, broad nasal bridge and small palpebral fissures, in keeping with a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome. Prior genetic testing includes chromosomal microarray performed 2025-12-07, reported as negative."

Events have occurred intermittently over the past few years, sometimes clustering during periods of sleep disruption, and have impacted school participation due to recovery time after episodes. Her record also documents other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry. Prior metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma lactate in the range of 3.2–4.1 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) on repeat draws, with occasional mild elevation of serum ammonia to 62–75 µmol/L (reference <50), without a clear acute illness trigger noted in the chart. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood and for a paternal cousin with recurrent generalized convulsions. The parents are first cousins, and there is no additional pedigree detail available in the current referral information."

A metabolic workup has shown chronically elevated serum lactate in the 3.2–4.8 mmol/L range on repeat measurements, with intermittent mild metabolic acidosis during intercurrent illnesses (lowest documented bicarbonate 17 mmol/L), consistent with an ongoing disorder of mitochondrial metabolism rather than a single episodic event.

Caregivers describe intermittent unsteadiness with a wide-based, clumsy gait and difficulty with rapid alternating movements, most apparent when tired and leading to frequent tripping and slowed participation in age-appropriate play. During acute illnesses he has had documented low serum bicarbonate consistent with metabolic acidosis, with representative prior values including bicarbonate 14–16 mmol/L and anion gap 18–22, improving toward baseline (bicarbonate ~22 mmol/L) between episodes; these events have been described as recurring rather than isolated. No additional neurologic syndrome is stated beyond the observed ataxia. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with longstanding gait unsteadiness/coordination problems and a paternal cousin with recurrent episodes of “acid buildup” requiring emergency evaluation; there is no reported consanguinity. Overall history reflects episodic metabolic decompensation with measurable acidosis alongside persistent functional motor incoordination affecting daily activities."

Caregivers describe delayed acquisition of gross motor skills, with fatigue during prolonged sitting or standing and a need for frequent rest breaks during play; there are no described episodic regressions. Feeding history is notable for lactose intolerance, with reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose-containing foods, including loose stools and abdominal discomfort that improve with lactose avoidance. Metabolic evaluation has shown lactose challenge–associated increases in stool reducing substances and acidic stool pH (e.g., pH ~5.0) consistent with carbohydrate malabsorption during exposures, with symptoms recurring when lactose is reintroduced. Family history is significant for a first-degree relative with similar lactose-related gastrointestinal intolerance, and a sibling reported to have low muscle tone in early childhood requiring physical therapy. No consanguinity is reported."

Seizure history is described as generalized events with impaired awareness and bilateral shaking, lasting a few minutes with postictal sleepiness and next-day fatigue; episodes have occurred intermittently rather than daily, without any history of prolonged convulsive episodes requiring emergent treatment for status epilepticus. From a metabolic standpoint, clinical records include persistently low lactase activity consistent with congenital lactase deficiency, and stool testing during symptomatic periods has shown acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances, supporting carbohydrate malabsorption during exposures.

Developmental history includes a specific motor coordination disorder with longstanding clumsiness and poor fine and gross motor control, described as difficulty with tasks such as handwriting, using utensils, and participating in age-peers’ sports, with frequent tripping and slower acquisition of coordinated movements. Dysmorphic features are noted on exam with mild facial asymmetry and low-set ears in the context of a congenital malformation syndrome with predominant facial involvement. Functional impact includes fatigue with prolonged walking and avoidance of activities requiring balance and rapid coordination. Prior genetic evaluation is documented: single-gene testing performed on 2026-01-19 was negative."

Neurologically, caregivers describe recurrent generalized convulsive seizures with postictal confusion and fatigue, and there is concern for episodes lasting several minutes with occasional clustering, impacting school attendance and requiring close supervision during activities. Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, including a paternal uncle with a phenylalanine metabolism disorder requiring dietary management and a maternal cousin with generalized epilepsy. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives with seizure disorders across both sides of the family."

Current functioning is limited by easy fatigability with prolonged activity, with persistent low muscle tone on exam by report. Her metabolic history includes episodes of metabolic acidosis with documented low serum bicarbonate and elevated anion gap during intercurrent illnesses; prior labs have shown bicarbonate as low as 14–16 mmol/L with venous pH around 7.28–7.32, improving with treatment but recurring over time, consistent with episodic rather than single isolated findings. During stable periods, bicarbonate has been closer to the low-normal range (18–21 mmol/L). Family history is significant for similarly affected relatives, including a younger brother with neonatal hypotonia and recurrent acidosis episodes requiring emergency evaluation. The parents are first cousins, and there is also a maternal cousin reported to have recurrent “acidotic crises” in childhood."
