Events have occurred without clear triggers and have required emergency evaluation on multiple occasions. Clinical concerns also include persistently abnormal laboratory studies, with intermittently elevated liver transaminases and lactate, raising suspicion for an underlying metabolic disorder contributing to her neurologic symptoms. Parents report no clear developmental regression, but they have noticed increased clumsiness and occasional difficulty with balance following these episodes. There is a family history of a paternal uncle with epilepsy beginning in adolescence, as well as a maternal grandfather with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. No consanguinity is reported. Prior evaluation has included routine blood work and brain imaging; neuroimaging has reportedly been unremarkable, while metabolic screening has shown mild, nonspecific abnormalities that have prompted referral for further genetic and metabolic assessment."

Parents report episodes of lethargy and irritability, particularly during minor illnesses or prolonged fasting, raising concern for an underlying disturbance of intermediary metabolism. Laboratory evaluations from the referring provider reportedly showed nonspecific abnormalities suggestive of a metabolic disorder affecting cellular energy handling, and further workup is in progress. Neurologically, caregivers have noticed that Brian appears “wobbly” when attempting supported sitting and has poorly coordinated limb movements for age. Examination today is notable for truncal instability and impaired coordination of purposeful reaching, consistent with early cerebellar ataxia, though muscle tone and strength are otherwise grossly appropriate for age. Developmental milestones are otherwise loosely on track. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with progressive gait imbalance and frequent falls beginning in adolescence, as well as a paternal cousin who required evaluation for an unexplained metabolic condition in early childhood."

Over the past several years, his parents have observed episodes of unsteadiness and clumsiness, particularly when he is fatigued, with a broad-based, wavering gait and difficulty with coordinated fine motor tasks such as handwriting and buttoning clothes. Teachers report that he occasionally appears shaky when reaching for objects and has trouble with rapid alternating movements during school-based motor assessments. Clinical concerns also include chronically abnormal blood test results of unclear significance, with repeatedly documented elevations outside the reference range prompting evaluation for an underlying metabolic or systemic disorder. There is no history of acute intoxication, trauma, or major systemic illness to account for these findings. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with “poor balance” beginning in mid-adulthood, requiring use of a cane in his 50s, though he has never received a specific diagnosis.

Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures that improved with medication, and a paternal cousin reportedly evaluated for “abnormal liver tests” in adolescence, though details are limited. No known consanguinity is reported. Mark currently follows with neurology and metabolic specialists, and further genetic evaluation is being pursued to clarify an underlying etiology."

Events are described as sudden staring with unresponsiveness followed at times by generalized tonic-clonic activity, tongue biting, and postictal confusion. Seizures have occurred both during sleep and wakefulness, with no consistent triggers identified. She is currently followed by neurology and treated with antiseizure medication, with partial reduction in event frequency but no complete remission. Interictal periods are generally well, though parents report intermittent fatigue and mild headaches. Recent laboratory evaluation has shown persistently abnormal serum markers suggestive of an underlying metabolic disturbance, prompting further workup to assess for an inborn error of metabolism or other systemic cause contributing to her seizure susceptibility. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset epilepsy that resolved in adolescence, and a paternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. There is no known history of sudden unexplained death in the family."

Physical examination documents distinctive craniofacial features consistent with a recognizable pattern of congenital malformation, along with external ear anomalies including abnormal positioning and shape. Neuroimaging has demonstrated underdevelopment of the cerebral hemispheres, contributing to his developmental profile. Cardiac evaluation identified a defect involving the atrial septum, for which he is under ongoing cardiology follow‑up. Overall appearance and growth pattern raise concern for an underlying syndromic condition affecting multiple organ systems.

Since early childhood, caregivers have observed unusual facial and craniofacial features, including asymmetry of the external ears and a generally disproportionate facial appearance, prompting evaluation for an underlying syndromic diagnosis. She also carries a diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease, including a defect in the tissue separating the upper heart chambers and malformation of the outflow tract from the right ventricle, for which she has undergone cardiology follow-up and prior surgical assessment. Growth and development have remained globally delayed, with persistent challenges in fine and gross motor skills and learning. Physical examination is remarkable for multiple congenital anomalies and a pattern of dysmorphic features consistent with a recognizable congenital syndrome. Prior genetic testing with chromosomal microarray analysis was nondiagnostic (reported as negative), and she is now referred for further genomic evaluation to clarify an underlying etiology and guide management."

Since early childhood, caregivers have observed delayed language acquisition and need for ongoing support with daily living skills. Birth and early growth were complicated by multiple structural anomalies, including congenital deformity of the feet consistent with clubfoot‑type positioning and abnormal shaping of the skull and facial structures, with persistent craniofacial asymmetry and characteristic facial features on examination. Cardiac history is significant for a congenital malformation of the outflow tract involving the pulmonary valve region, followed by pediatric cardiology with prior interventions discussed in the chart. Overall appearance and pattern of congenital findings raise concern for an underlying syndromic etiology affecting growth and craniofacial development. Prior genetic evaluation included a targeted gene panel, which was reported as negative, without identification of a causative variant. Daniel continues to receive multidisciplinary care, including developmental, orthopedic, and cardiology follow‑up."

He continues to require support for activities of daily living and structured educational services. Since infancy, his head shape has been described as abnormal, with a congenitally small head circumference and persistent microcephaly. Physical examination has repeatedly noted multiple minor anomalies and a pattern of dysmorphic features consistent with an underlying congenital syndrome, including abnormal craniofacial proportions and atypical skull contour suggestive of a primary brain malformation. Clinical concerns include difficulties with adaptive functioning, limited expressive language, and concrete reasoning skills, though behavior has been generally cooperative without significant psychiatric comorbidity. There is no known family history of similar neurodevelopmental or congenital findings. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing targeting a suspected syndrome, which was negative, and he is now referred for broader genetic assessment to better define an etiologic diagnosis and guide anticipatory management and counseling."

Over time she has continued to demonstrate low muscle tone and reduced endurance, with difficulty keeping up with peers in physical activities and occasional complaints of leg fatigue after minimal exertion. Clinical concerns also include features suggestive of an underlying metabolic disturbance affecting energy utilization, with intermittent episodes of worsened fatigue during intercurrent illness and mild weight fluctuations despite stable dietary intake. There is no history of seizures or regression.

Caregivers report intermittent episodes of unexplained fatigue and poor tolerance of fasting, raising concern for an underlying disturbance of metabolic homeostasis; prior evaluations have suggested a possible disorder of intermediary metabolism, though a specific diagnosis has not yet been established. Clinical course has also been complicated by a prior superficial burn injury to the face requiring acute care, as well as a scalp laceration from minor head trauma that healed without neurologic sequelae. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset epilepsy and a paternal cousin with an unspecified inborn error of metabolism requiring dietary management.

Clinical concerns also include intermittent neuromuscular irritability in the neonatal period, with episodes of increased tone and jitteriness noted shortly after birth, gradually improving but prompting ongoing developmental surveillance. Parents report a prior hospitalization in early infancy for evaluation of unusual movements and irritability, during which metabolic workup suggested vulnerability to nutritional and electrolyte shifts, and she has since been monitored for metabolic stability during intercurrent illnesses. There is a history of an accidental exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic resulting in acute gastrointestinal distress and rash, leading to its avoidance thereafter. Earlier in life she sustained a superficial facial burn from a hot liquid, which healed without complication but is documented in her medical record. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with “muscle stiffness” in childhood and a paternal grandmother with adult-onset type 2 diabetes."

Parents describe episodes of clumsiness, a wide-based gait at times, and trouble with fine motor tasks such as handwriting and buttoning clothes, which have become more apparent with increased academic demands. Clinical concerns also include persistently abnormal laboratory findings on prior metabolic evaluations, with unexplained elevations prompting ongoing assessment for an underlying metabolic or systemic disorder. There is no clear history of regression, but fatigue and exercise intolerance are intermittently reported. Kevin was previously treated in the emergency department for a superficial forehead laceration after a minor fall and, on a separate occasion, sustained a superficial facial burn from accidental contact with a hot surface; both injuries healed without complication but raised additional concern about balance and safety. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with longstanding coordination problems requiring use of a cane in adulthood, and a maternal grandfather reported to have “abnormal blood tests” of unclear etiology."

    "clinical_note": "Anthony Campbell (born 22 Feb 2007, intersex) is seen for longstanding neurologic and metabolic concerns. Since early childhood, history is notable for progressive difficulty with coordinated movements, described as clumsiness, wide‑based gait, and impaired fine motor skills affecting handwriting and utensil use. Parents report intermittent tremulousness when reaching for objects and frequent falls, without clear precipitating trauma. School notes describe slowed performance on tasks requiring motor planning, though cognitive abilities are otherwise age appropriate. Clinical concerns also include episodes of unexplained lethargy and light sensitivity, with occasional nausea after prolonged outdoor activity; diet is somewhat self‑restricted due to aversion to certain protein‑rich foods. Growth has tracked along the lower percentiles but remains stable. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with an undiagnosed movement disorder beginning in adolescence and progressive gait imbalance. A paternal grandfather reportedly had type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in his 60s, and a maternal grandmother has hypothyroidism. No prior genetic testing has been documented."

    "clinical_note": "Mark Brown (born 2013-03-20, intersex) is seen for ongoing neurologic and metabolic concerns. Since early childhood, history is notable for intermittent episodes of lethargy, poor feeding during intercurrent illness, and laboratory evidence of disordered amino acid metabolism consistent with a defect in phenylalanine processing. Parents report that when dietary intake is not carefully monitored, Mark becomes irritable, has difficulty concentrating, and occasionally complains of headaches and nausea. Neurologic history includes periods of increased muscle tone in the neonatal period, with early life stiffness and jitteriness that gradually improved but left mild residual clumsiness and fine motor incoordination. There have been no documented seizures, but teachers have raised concerns about variable attention and slowed processing during more cognitively demanding tasks.  \n\nFamily history is notable for a maternal uncle with type 1 diabetes diagnosed in adolescence and a paternal grandmother with late-onset breast cancer. A younger sibling has well-controlled asthma. Parents deny known consanguinity, and there is no known family history of similar metabolic or neurologic symptoms."
