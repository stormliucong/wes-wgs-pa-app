He also carries a history of acidosis with recurrent low serum bicarbonate on prior chemistry panels, consistent with a metabolic acidosis pattern; recent representative labs show CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on multiple checks with an anion gap around 10–12, and venous blood gas pH 7.30–7.33, indicating a persistent rather than isolated abnormality. Episodes are reported to be more noticeable during intercurrent illness with worsened fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, but baseline low bicarbonate has also been documented. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with long-standing problems with balance and coordination described as “ataxia,” and a paternal cousin with recurrent metabolic acidosis requiring hospital evaluation in childhood; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Records describe persistent hyperphenylalaninemia on monitoring, with plasma phenylalanine typically in the 900–1200 µmol/L range on several checks over the past year (most recently 1050 µmol/L), with comparatively normal tyrosine around 55–75 µmol/L, consistent with ongoing elevation rather than a single episodic spike. Clinically, he has had intermittent seizure-like events characterized by sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking, lasting approximately 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for 20–30 minutes; episodes have occurred a few times per year and have resulted in missed school days after events. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a childhood-onset seizure disorder and a maternal cousin reported to have elevated phenylalanine on newborn screening requiring ongoing dietary management."

Parents report these coordination problems are persistent rather than episodic and interfere with age-appropriate play. Laboratory history is notable for other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry; available records show persistently elevated serum lactate in the 3.0–3.8 mmol/L range (ref 0.5–2.2) on repeat measurements over several months, with intermittent mild elevation of plasma ammonia to 70–85 µmol/L (ref <50). These biochemical findings have been documented on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated result. Family history is significant for consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A paternal uncle is reported to have longstanding gait unsteadiness and poor coordination since childhood, and a maternal cousin has a history of recurrent abnormal blood chemistry testing described by the family as “high lactate,” without additional documented details."

    "clinical_note": "Justin Morris is a 15-year-old male with history notable for a disorder of mitochondrial metabolism and recurrent seizure-like episodes. Events have been described as sudden spells of unresponsiveness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for up to an hour; frequency has been intermittent with clusters during intercurrent illness and after missed meals, impacting school attendance and sports participation. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently elevated plasma lactate (3.8–4.6 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (28–32), and episodic mild metabolic acidosis during febrile illnesses (bicarbonate 17–19 mmol/L). Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A maternal uncle reportedly had childhood-onset seizures, and a paternal cousin has a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic disorder with exercise intolerance. No prior genetic test results were available for review in the record provided.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent right ankle sprain with pain and swelling after an inversion injury, and a concussion without loss of consciousness following a head impact, with transient headache and dizziness that resolved over several days."

    "clinical_note": "Deborah Moore is a 4-year-old female seen after multiple acute injuries and an ingestion event. History is notable for an open wound of the scalp with active bleeding at the time of presentation, described as a laceration without mention of intracranial involvement; the family reports it occurred suddenly and required prompt wound care due to persistent oozing and tenderness at the site. She also has an acute burn involving the head/face/neck region, described as a burn of unspecified degree, with localized pain and erythema; the affected area is sensitive to touch and has interfered with normal sleep and routine activities. In addition, there is concern for accidental penicillin exposure with features consistent with poisoning by penicillins, described as an unintentional ingestion; caregivers report the event was abrupt and prompted urgent evaluation for potential medication toxicity. Family history is notable for consanguinity, with the parents reported to be first cousins. No prior diagnostic testing results were provided in the available record for today’s visit."

    "clinical_note": "Helen Edwards is a 8-year-old female seen following an acute head injury consistent with concussion without loss of consciousness. History describes immediate headache and light sensitivity after the event, with transient dizziness and nausea but no reported blackout; she has had difficulty concentrating and increased fatigue that have interfered with schoolwork since the injury. She also sustained an unspecified burn of the head and face; exam documentation notes erythema and superficial blistering involving facial skin without a clearly recorded depth, with localized pain and tenderness. In addition, there is an episode of accidental exposure to a systemic antibiotic in the penicillin class, described as an unintentional ingestion/medication error; following the exposure she developed acute gastrointestinal upset with vomiting and abdominal discomfort, without details suggesting intent of self-harm. No family history or consanguinity information was provided. No prior genetic or diagnostic testing results were available in the record for review."
