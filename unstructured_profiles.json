He also carries a history of acidosis with recurrent low serum bicarbonate on prior chemistry panels, consistent with a metabolic acidosis pattern; recent representative labs show CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on multiple checks with an anion gap around 10–12, and venous blood gas pH 7.30–7.33, indicating a persistent rather than isolated abnormality. Episodes are reported to be more noticeable during intercurrent illness with worsened fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, but baseline low bicarbonate has also been documented. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with long-standing problems with balance and coordination described as “ataxia,” and a paternal cousin with recurrent metabolic acidosis requiring hospital evaluation in childhood; no parental consanguinity is reported."

Records describe persistent hyperphenylalaninemia on monitoring, with plasma phenylalanine typically in the 900–1200 µmol/L range on several checks over the past year (most recently 1050 µmol/L), with comparatively normal tyrosine around 55–75 µmol/L, consistent with ongoing elevation rather than a single episodic spike. Clinically, he has had intermittent seizure-like events characterized by sudden loss of awareness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic shaking, lasting approximately 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for 20–30 minutes; episodes have occurred a few times per year and have resulted in missed school days after events. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle with a childhood-onset seizure disorder and a maternal cousin reported to have elevated phenylalanine on newborn screening requiring ongoing dietary management."

Parents report these coordination problems are persistent rather than episodic and interfere with age-appropriate play. Laboratory history is notable for other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry; available records show persistently elevated serum lactate in the 3.0–3.8 mmol/L range (ref 0.5–2.2) on repeat measurements over several months, with intermittent mild elevation of plasma ammonia to 70–85 µmol/L (ref <50). These biochemical findings have been documented on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated result. Family history is significant for consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A paternal uncle is reported to have longstanding gait unsteadiness and poor coordination since childhood, and a maternal cousin has a history of recurrent abnormal blood chemistry testing described by the family as “high lactate,” without additional documented details."

Events have been described as sudden spells of unresponsiveness with generalized stiffening and rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes, followed by post-event sleepiness and confusion for up to an hour; frequency has been intermittent with clusters during intercurrent illness and after missed meals, impacting school attendance and sports participation. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistently elevated plasma lactate (3.8–4.6 mmol/L; reference 0.5–2.2) with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (28–32), and episodic mild metabolic acidosis during febrile illnesses (bicarbonate 17–19 mmol/L). Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A maternal uncle reportedly had childhood-onset seizures, and a paternal cousin has a diagnosed mitochondrial metabolic disorder with exercise intolerance. No prior genetic test results were available for review in the record provided.\n\nSecondary medical issues include a recent right ankle sprain with pain and swelling after an inversion injury, and a concussion without loss of consciousness following a head impact, with transient headache and dizziness that resolved over several days."

History is notable for an open wound of the scalp with active bleeding at the time of presentation, described as a laceration without mention of intracranial involvement; the family reports it occurred suddenly and required prompt wound care due to persistent oozing and tenderness at the site. She also has an acute burn involving the head/face/neck region, described as a burn of unspecified degree, with localized pain and erythema; the affected area is sensitive to touch and has interfered with normal sleep and routine activities. In addition, there is concern for accidental penicillin exposure with features consistent with poisoning by penicillins, described as an unintentional ingestion; caregivers report the event was abrupt and prompted urgent evaluation for potential medication toxicity.

Records describe persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine on metabolic monitoring, with representative values around 680–820 µmol/L on several checks, while tyrosine has remained within reference range; elevations are described as chronic rather than episodic and have been tracked longitudinally. Early history includes decreased neonatal tone with “floppy” appearance and reduced spontaneous movement noted in the newborn period; caregivers reported weak antigravity limb activity and poor head control early on, with gradual improvement over time. There is a relevant family history of similar phenylalanine metabolism disorder in an older sibling and a paternal cousin, both described as requiring ongoing biochemical monitoring. The parents are first cousins, which is documented in the family pedigree. No additional syndromic features are described beyond the above, and the clinical narrative remains focused on the metabolic phenotype and the early hypotonia noted in infancy."

He has had intermittent nutritional monitoring, and recent labs obtained during symptomatic periods showed a positive stool reducing substances test and low stool pH (5.0), with otherwise stable basic metabolic parameters; the pattern has been persistent rather than episodic. Neurologic history is notable for ataxia manifested as unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, with difficulty running and frequent tripping compared with peers; fine motor tasks such as handwriting and utensil use are described as clumsy, with fluctuating severity but ongoing functional impact at school and during sports.

    "clinical_note": "Anthony Davis is a 3-year-old male with history notable for episodic seizures of unclear type, described by caregivers as sudden stiffening with rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes and followed by several hours of sleepiness; events have occurred intermittently since infancy and have led to urgent evaluations. He also carries a history of acidosis, with prior laboratory documentation of low serum bicarbonate (typically 14–16 mmol/L) and an elevated anion gap (about 18–22), noted on more than one occasion rather than as a single isolated finding. Caregivers report these acidotic episodes are most apparent during intercurrent illnesses with decreased oral intake, when he becomes more fatigued and tachypneic, prompting repeat blood testing. Family history is significant for consanguinity, as the parents are first cousins. A paternal uncle is reported to have had recurrent seizures beginning in childhood, and a maternal cousin has a history of episodic “blood acid” problems requiring hospital care, without further diagnostic details available in the record."

Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, most recently 780 µmol/L (reference 30–120) with tyrosine at the low end of normal at 35 µmol/L (reference 30–120), with prior values typically ranging 600–900 µmol/L during periods of dietary liberalization. Caregivers describe sensitivity of levels to protein intake, with episodic rises noted after higher-protein meals. Neurologically, he has recurrent generalized seizures that remain difficult to control, occurring several times per month with postictal sleepiness and missed school days; there has been no history of convulsive status epilepticus.

Neurologic history is notable for episodes of seizures without a specified type; events have been intermittent, with sudden onset of altered responsiveness and generalized shaking reported by family, followed by post-event sleepiness, and these episodes have interfered with school attendance on days they occur. Metabolic evaluation has shown low lactase activity consistent with congenital lactase deficiency, and nutritional monitoring has included periodic stool testing demonstrating persistently acidic stool (pH ~5.0) with positive reducing substances during symptomatic periods after lactose exposure. Family history is significant for similar dairy intolerance in the father and recurrent seizure episodes in a paternal uncle. The parents are first cousins."

Cardiac history includes a secundum atrial septal defect identified in childhood, followed clinically without additional detail available in this record. Neurodevelopmental history is significant for a specific developmental disorder of motor function, with longstanding fine- and gross-motor coordination difficulties that affect handwriting, dressing skills, and participation in age-appropriate sports, without characterization here as a broader cognitive disorder. He has multiple congenital anomalies consistent with the above syndrome and associated findings. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2025-10-18, reported as negative."

She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with reproducible gastrointestinal intolerance to lactose-containing foods. Caregivers report that even small amounts of milk or ice cream trigger watery diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain within a few hours, with improvement when lactose is strictly avoided. Prior metabolic evaluation has documented low small-bowel lactase activity (0.5 U/g; reference ≥10 U/g) and repeated low lactose tolerance testing with minimal rise in serum glucose after lactose load (increase 8 mg/dL), consistent with a persistent enzymatic deficiency rather than intermittent intolerance. Family history is significant for an older brother with similar lifelong lactose-triggered diarrhea requiring strict dietary avoidance, and a maternal aunt reported to have had low muscle tone in infancy requiring physical therapy. Parents deny consanguinity."

    "clinical_note": "Jennifer Wright is a 6-year-old female with history notable for congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong intolerance to lactose-containing foods. Since infancy, exposure to breast milk/formula or later dairy products has reliably triggered profuse watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, and irritability, with improvement on strict lactose avoidance; even small amounts of hidden lactose (e.g., in processed foods) can provoke symptoms within hours. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent carbohydrate malabsorption consistent with lactase deficiency, including repeated stool testing with acidic pH around 5.0 and positive reducing substances (1–2+), and breath hydrogen testing demonstrating a marked rise after lactose challenge (baseline 8 ppm to 62 ppm at 90 minutes). Neurologic history includes ataxia manifested by an unsteady, wide-based gait and poor coordination, with frequent tripping and difficulty with tandem walking and stairs, affecting playground activities; symptoms are described as chronic rather than episodic. Family history is notable for lactose intolerance in the father and a paternal aunt with longstanding dairy-triggered diarrhea; parents deny consanguinity."

    "clinical_note": "Barbara Phillips is a 6-year-old female with history notable for a disorder of aromatic amino-acid metabolism with episodic biochemical decompensation and associated motor incoordination. During intercurrent illness and periods of reduced intake, caregivers report worsening unsteady gait and clumsiness with frequent stumbling and difficulty with tandem walking, consistent with ataxia that interferes with play and school activities. Between episodes, coordination improves but she remains more accident-prone than peers. Prior metabolic monitoring has shown elevated plasma phenylalanine, including a recent value of 980 µmol/L during a symptomatic period with partial improvement to 420 µmol/L on repeat testing when clinically stable, supporting a persistent tendency toward hyperphenylalaninemia with episodic worsening. Family history is significant for a paternal uncle described as having a similar amino-acid metabolism disorder requiring lifelong dietary management, and a maternal cousin with childhood-onset gait unsteadiness. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports multiple relatives from the same extended lineage with comparable metabolic concerns."

Neurologic exam has been characterized by gait ataxia with impaired balance on turning and inconsistent heel-to-shin performance, without describing a separate movement disorder diagnosis. Metabolic evaluation has supported a mitochondrial metabolism disorder with episodic elevations in serum lactate, including a documented lactate of 3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) during intercurrent illness and a repeat fasting lactate of 2.6 mmol/L on a well day, suggesting a persistent tendency toward mild hyperlactatemia with worsening during physiologic stress.

Motor development has been impacted by persistent fine- and gross-motor incoordination, including clumsiness and difficulty with tasks requiring bilateral coordination and motor planning, affecting handwriting, dressing, and participation in age-appropriate sports. Neurodevelopmental history is also significant for a congenital malformation syndrome with dysmorphic features; on exam he has mild facial asymmetry and low-set ears. He carries a diagnosis consistent with a defined congenital malformation syndrome rather than an isolated anomaly, and his multisystem history has been followed in that context. There is no additional symptom complex described beyond what is captured by his known cardiac and brain malformations and coordination disorder. Prior genetic evaluation included a gene panel performed on 2025-09-29, which was reported as negative."

Since early childhood, she has had an unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent tripping, difficulty with tandem walking, and clumsiness with tasks requiring rapid alternating movements; symptoms fluctuate with exertion and intercurrent illness and have interfered with sports participation and handwriting endurance at school. Metabolic monitoring has shown episodic lactic acid elevations consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including venous lactate 4.8 mmol/L during a viral illness and a repeat baseline lactate 2.6 mmol/L on a well day, with an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 28; serum CK has been mildly increased at 320 U/L on one occasion. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with a similar lifelong unsteady gait and exercise intolerance, and a maternal grandmother reported to have episodic fatigue with prolonged exertion; there is no reported consanguinity."

Examination is notable for mild dysmorphic features, including a long philtrum and low-set ears. She also carries a diagnosis of congenital lactase deficiency with gastrointestinal symptoms beginning in early childhood; caregivers report reproducible watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating after ingestion of milk or standard dairy products, with improvement when lactose is avoided. Prior records include metabolic support consistent with lactase deficiency, including a lactose challenge associated with a rise in breath hydrogen to 45 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes and acidic stool (pH 5.0) during symptomatic episodes, suggesting persistent lactose sensitivity rather than episodic intolerance. Family history is significant for a paternal aunt with longstanding dairy-triggered diarrhea consistent with lactase deficiency and a younger brother with hypotonia noted in infancy; parents deny consanguinity. Chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-08-20 was negative."

He also carries a history of acidosis; available laboratory data show persistently low serum bicarbonate around 16–18 mmol/L with a mildly elevated anion gap (approximately 18–20) on repeat checks, with episodes of worsening fatigue and tachypnea during intercurrent illness when bicarbonate has fallen to ~14 mmol/L. Dysmorphic features include a long narrow face and low-set ears on exam. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity; the parents are first cousins. A paternal aunt reportedly has a seizure disorder beginning in adolescence, and a maternal cousin has a history of recurrent “acidotic” hospitalizations in childhood per family report.

Dysmorphic findings include a congenital eyelid anomaly described as ectropion, with outward turning of the lid margin noted since infancy, and a congenital foot deformity characterized as talipes equinovarus affecting the feet. Motor development has been impacted by a specific developmental disorder of motor function, with longstanding difficulty in coordination and motor planning that has interfered with age-appropriate gross and fine motor tasks (e.g., running, stair negotiation, handwriting, and self-care skills), requiring extra time and support for daily activities. Physical phenotype and functional history are reviewed in the context of the above congenital anomalies without attributing causality among co-existing findings. Prior genetic testing is documented: chromosomal microarray (CMA) performed on 2025-12-21 was negative."

Since early toddlerhood, caregivers describe an unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent stumbles, difficulty navigating stairs without support, and impaired balance that is more apparent with fatigue and during intercurrent illnesses; there is no report of a focal weakness pattern, but coordination limits age-appropriate running and playground activities. Metabolic evaluation has shown recurrent elevations of serum lactate, with values ranging 3.8–5.6 mmol/L (reference 0.5–2.2) on multiple draws, including during baseline health, along with intermittently increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (up to 28), supporting an ongoing mitochondrial metabolic disturbance rather than a single episodic finding. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. A maternal uncle is reported to have a similar longstanding unsteady gait beginning in childhood, and a paternal cousin has a documented mitochondrial metabolism disorder with episodic fatigue and exercise intolerance."

Episodes are described as sudden loss of awareness with whole-body stiffening and rhythmic jerking, followed by postictal sleepiness and headache, occurring several times per month despite adherence to prescribed antiseizure therapy. Between events, caregivers report variable fatigue and reduced stamina on school days after seizures. Metabolic evaluation has shown persistent acidosis consistent with a chronic tendency toward low serum bicarbonate; recent labs have included CO₂ (bicarbonate) 16–18 mmol/L on repeat measurements with a mildly elevated anion gap (18–20), without clear episodic resolution, and these findings have been followed over time in the context of her neurologic history.

    "clinical_note": "Donna Hall is a 7-year-old female with history notable for phenylketonuria and epilepsy characterized by other generalized seizures without status epilepticus. Metabolic monitoring has shown persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine despite dietary sensitivity, with recent values around 780 µmol/L (reference 30–120) and prior measurements typically ranging 600–900 µmol/L, while plasma tyrosine has been low-normal at approximately 35 µmol/L (reference 40–90). Caregivers describe that higher phenylalanine levels tend to coincide with increased irritability and reduced attention at school, though no acute metabolic decompensation episodes are reported. Seizure history is described as generalized events with abrupt loss of awareness and bilateral stiffening followed by rhythmic jerking lasting 1–2 minutes, occurring about 1–2 times per month, with postictal sleepiness for up to an hour; no episodes have progressed to status epilepticus. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset generalized epilepsy and a paternal cousin diagnosed with phenylketonuria identified on newborn screening; no consanguinity is reported."

Events are described as sudden spells with loss of awareness and generalized stiffening/jerking lasting about 1–2 minutes, followed by several minutes of confusion and marked fatigue; episodes occur roughly every 1–2 months, sometimes after sleep deprivation, and have led to missed school days and restrictions in independent activities. No specific seizure syndrome is documented in available records. Metabolic evaluation has shown repeated biochemical abnormalities, including chronically elevated plasma lactate in the 3.8–4.6 mmol/L range (reference 0.5–2.2) on multiple draws over the past year, with intermittent mild hyperammonemia up to 72 µmol/L (reference <35) during periods of illness, returning closer to baseline afterward; basic electrolytes have otherwise been reported within reference ranges when checked. Family history is significant for parental consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. A paternal uncle reportedly has a history of recurrent seizures beginning in adolescence, and a maternal cousin has been followed for persistent unexplained elevations in lactate on screening labs."

She also has congenital lactase deficiency with lifelong lactose intolerance; even small amounts of milk, ice cream, or soft cheeses reliably trigger crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and watery diarrhea within a few hours. Symptoms are persistent rather than episodic and improve with strict lactose avoidance. Recent dietary review supports continued sensitivity to hidden lactose in processed foods. Metabolic evaluation has included stool testing showing repeatedly low lactase activity (0.5 U/g; reference ≥10 U/g) with normal sucrase and maltase, consistent with isolated lactase deficiency, and breath hydrogen testing after lactose challenge with a peak rise of 38 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes.

He also has congenital polycystic kidney disease, described as multiple renal cysts consistent with a hereditary cystic kidney disorder; clinical follow-up has focused on renal involvement rather than acquired causes. Dysmorphic features have been noted on exam, including low-set ears and a flat nasal bridge, in the context of a congenital malformation syndrome affecting multiple systems. The overall phenotype is consistent with a syndromic presentation with both central nervous system and renal involvement, along with characteristic facial findings. Prior genetic workup included single-gene testing performed on 2025-11-13, which was reported as negative."

Metabolic evaluation has shown a lactose malabsorption pattern with a hydrogen breath test demonstrating a rise of 32 ppm above baseline at 90 minutes after lactose load, consistent with persistent lactose sensitivity rather than episodic intolerance. Neurologic history is significant for other generalized epilepsy without status epilepticus, with recurrent generalized convulsive seizures described as sudden loss of awareness followed by bilateral tonic-clonic activity lasting about 1–2 minutes, occurring approximately every 1–2 months, followed by postictal confusion and fatigue that can persist for several hours and has led to missed school days. Family history includes a maternal uncle with a seizure disorder beginning in adolescence and a father with longstanding lactose intolerance; parents deny consanguinity."

Caregivers describe recurrent convulsive episodes with impaired awareness, occurring intermittently since infancy, with post-ictal sleepiness and temporary decline in responsiveness afterward; events have been disruptive to daily routines and require close supervision for safety. Her record also documents an “other specified abnormal finding of blood chemistry,” and available laboratory data support a persistent pattern rather than a single transient result, including repeated elevations of serum lactate around 3.2–3.8 mmol/L (ref 0.5–2.2) and mildly increased alanine on plasma amino acids (e.g., 610 µmol/L, ref 200–500), noted on more than one draw without clear normalization between episodes. Family history is significant for seizures in a maternal uncle beginning in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and the family reports no other specifically characterized neurologic diagnoses in close relatives beyond the seizure history described."

Prior laboratory monitoring has shown phenylalanine levels chronically above the expected range (e.g., 620–780 µmol/L on repeat plasma amino acids) with relatively normal tyrosine, and caregivers report dietary sensitivity with higher levels after increased natural protein intake. Neurologic history includes congenital hypotonia, described since infancy as low axial tone with delayed acquisition of head control and ongoing easy fatigability with gross motor tasks; he requires frequent rest breaks during running and climbing and has mild difficulty maintaining upright posture for prolonged sitting. Family history is significant for a sibling with elevated phenylalanine identified on newborn screening and managed with dietary restriction, and a maternal uncle reported to have a similar amino-acid disorder in childhood. The parents are first cousins, and there is no reported family history of neuromuscular disease outside the above.\n\nSecondary medical issues include an acute unintentional exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, an initial encounter for a scalp laceration without foreign body, and an initial encounter for a right ankle sprain involving unspecified ligament, each described as isolated events without chronic sequelae noted in the available history."

Family reports periods of easy fatigability with intercurrent infections and prolonged recovery compared with peers. He also carries a diagnosis of other generalized epilepsy with intractable epilepsy, without status epilepticus, described as recurrent generalized seizures that have persisted despite medication trials, with ongoing breakthrough events that disrupt school attendance and require close supervision for safety. Parents report that seizures are not limited to a single time of day and may cluster during periods of sleep deprivation or febrile illness, though no episodes of status epilepticus are described. Family history is significant for consanguinity, with the parents being first cousins. There is also a reported history of seizures in a maternal uncle and a paternal cousin, though specific epilepsy syndromes are not documented.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories: He has had an accidental exposure/ingestion to a penicillin-class antibiotic prompting acute evaluation, and he also has a documented concussion without loss of consciousness following a head injury, with subsequent monitoring for post-concussive symptoms."

Prior testing includes an outpatient EEG dated 2024-08-14 reported as showing generalized epileptiform discharges, supporting a generalized seizure tendency.\n\nSecondary medical issues/histories: He has a documented right ankle sprain from an inversion injury, treated as an acute ligamentous sprain. He also has a history of concussion without loss of consciousness after a minor head impact, with transient headache and light sensitivity noted at the time and subsequent return to baseline per follow-up documentation."

History is notable for a recent head impact followed by symptoms consistent with mild traumatic brain injury, including headache, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating, without any reported blackout or post-event amnesia. She describes increased sensitivity to bright light and screen use since the incident, with symptoms fluctuating through the day and interfering with schoolwork and reading. She also has a facial/head burn sustained around the same timeframe, described as painful with localized redness and tenderness; the depth is not clearly characterized at this visit. She reports discomfort with washing the affected area and notes that exposure to heat worsens the pain. No additional neurologic deficits are described beyond the concussion-related symptoms, and the encounter focuses on documenting the current symptom pattern and functional impact related to the head injury and the burn involving the head and face."

History is focused on the circumstances of the exposure and early symptoms; he has had transient gastrointestinal upset and fatigue since the event, without reported progression to severe systemic manifestations. In the same acute timeframe, he also sustained a concussion without loss of consciousness. Since the head injury, caregivers describe intermittent headache and irritability with brief episodes of dizziness, with reduced tolerance for active play and increased need for rest; there has been no history provided of a blackout at the time of injury. Symptoms have been episodic over the days since the injury and are noted to interfere with usual preschool activities due to fatigue and discomfort. No additional past history, family history, or prior diagnostic testing information was provided for review in this encounter."

    "clinical_note": "Stephanie Robinson is a 3-year-old female evaluated following an acute exposure to a systemic antibiotic consistent with a penicillin-class agent, described as an unintentional ingestion. Around the time of the exposure, caregivers noted symptoms prompting medical evaluation, and she was monitored for possible medication-related effects. In the same acute timeframe, she sustained a superficial thermal injury involving the head and face, without documentation of deeper tissue involvement; the involved skin was described as erythematous and tender, with no reported charring. She also experienced a concussion without loss of consciousness after a head injury, with subsequent transient post-injury symptoms such as headache, irritability, and fatigue impacting usual play, but without reported syncope. Clinical documentation supports that these events were managed as initial encounters for each condition, with attention to neurologic status and skin findings during observation. No prior genetic or metabolic testing information is available in the record provided, and family history details were not supplied for this encounter."

History is notable for a recent open wound of the scalp, described as a laceration with active bleeding at the time of injury and localized scalp tenderness; there is no description here of deeper cranial injury. He also has a sprain involving the right ankle, consistent with an acute twisting injury with pain and swelling around the ankle and difficulty bearing weight immediately afterward. Symptoms have been primarily mechanical, with discomfort worsened by walking and improved with rest and limited activity. Functional impact has included temporary limitation in running and play due to ankle pain, and the scalp wound required attention for bleeding control and wound care. No additional systemic symptoms are described in association with these injuries, and the clinical picture is focused on localized soft-tissue trauma to the scalp and a ligamentous injury at the right ankle."

She sustained a closed head impact with subsequent symptoms consistent with concussion without loss of consciousness, including headache and transient dizziness, with no reported blackout at the time of injury. Examination was notable for a linear scalp wound with localized tenderness and bleeding that required acute attention. The encounter is also notable for accidental ingestion of a penicillin-class antibiotic, described as an unintentional exposure requiring evaluation for medication-related effects; the history supports an acute event rather than a chronic medication problem. No additional neurologic deficits were documented beyond concussion-type symptoms, and the presentation is framed around immediate post-injury and post-ingestion monitoring needs. Family history, consanguinity, and prior genetic or diagnostic testing were not provided in the available record for this visit."

History is notable for a recent inversion-type ankle trauma with immediate lateral ankle pain and swelling and difficulty bearing weight; he has been limping and avoiding running and climbing since the injury. Caregivers describe focal tenderness around the right ankle with discomfort on movement, and he requires frequent rest breaks during play due to pain. In the same event, he sustained a head impact with subsequent symptoms consistent with concussion, including headache, brief confusion, and sensitivity to noise; there has been no reported loss of consciousness. Since the injury, he has been more irritable and fatigued than baseline, with intermittent nausea but no persistent vomiting. There are no described focal neurologic deficits, and caregivers deny witnessed seizure activity. Family history is notable for consanguinity: the parents are first cousins. No prior diagnostic testing results were provided for review at this visit."
