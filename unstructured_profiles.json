    "clinical_note": "Richard Green is a 13-year-old boy with a history notable for intermittent episodes of confusion, lethargy, and rapid breathing, often occurring during intercurrent illnesses. Parents describe several events over the past two years in which he developed sudden unresponsiveness with generalized shaking and postictal somnolence, without clear provoking factors. These events have raised concern for recurrent seizures, and he is currently under neurological evaluation. Between episodes, he returns to his baseline and is attending school with age-appropriate academic performance. Laboratory studies obtained during acute events have repeatedly shown abnormalities in blood acid–base balance, with elevated acid levels requiring intravenous fluids and close monitoring, raising suspicion for an underlying metabolic vulnerability contributing to his decompensations and seizure tendency. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset epilepsy that resolved in adolescence, and a paternal grandfather with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. There is no known history of similar metabolic crises or unexplained early deaths in the family."

Since infancy, she has been followed for a structural heart defect characterized by an abnormal connection between the upper heart chambers, with intermittent exertional fatigue but no reported cyanotic episodes. Early feeding was complicated by difficulty swallowing solid foods, later attributed to a congenital narrowing at the junction of the throat and esophagus, requiring careful dietary modification. Developmentally, she has moderate intellectual impairment, with delayed language acquisition and ongoing need for support in academic and adaptive skills; she attends a specialized education program and requires assistance with daily living tasks. Physical examination has consistently noted a pattern of congenital body differences, including subtle facial asymmetry and disproportion of body segments suggestive of an underlying syndromic diagnosis. A prior gene panel performed on 2025‑09‑30 was reported as negative, without identification of a causative variant. No significant family history of similar congenital anomalies or developmental difficulties has been documented."

He was born with marked asymmetry of the external ears, including malformation of the pinnae and abnormal positioning, accompanied by a high anterior hairline and subtle facial disproportion suggestive of an underlying craniofacial patterning defect. Neuroimaging in infancy demonstrated incomplete development of the cerebral hemispheres consistent with a form of brain malformation involving the forebrain, and he has shown persistent global developmental delay with slow acquisition of motor and language milestones. Ongoing concerns include short stature and poor overall growth velocity relative to age peers, raising suspicion for an underlying syndromic etiology affecting growth and development. Physical examination has repeatedly documented dysmorphic facial features with a constellation suggestive of a recognizable genetic syndrome involving multiple systems. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2025-12-08, which was reported as negative, and he is now referred for further comprehensive genomic assessment to better define the diagnosis and guide management."

Caregivers describe persistent “floppiness” in infancy, with ongoing challenges in maintaining posture and endurance during physical activities. Clinical concerns include intermittent episodes of fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, raising suspicion for an underlying metabolic disturbance affecting energy utilization. Growth has been appropriate, but parents report occasional poor stamina during common childhood illnesses. Neurologic examination has previously documented low muscle tone with preserved strength, and no clear evidence of progressive weakness or regression. There is a reported family history of neuromuscular symptoms in a maternal uncle, who required physical therapy for low muscle tone in childhood, though he now functions independently. In addition, a paternal grandfather has type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and a maternal grandmother has osteoporosis, without known neurologic involvement. No prior genetic testing has been documented, and the family is seeking further evaluation to clarify the etiology of Sandra’s neuromuscular and suspected metabolic issues."

Events reportedly began in mid-childhood and occur without clear triggers, including at rest and during routine activities. There is no history of head trauma or CNS infection. Clinical concerns also include persistently abnormal laboratory findings on prior metabolic screening, with repeatedly elevated serum markers suggesting an underlying biochemical disturbance, though a specific diagnosis has not yet been established. Parents report occasional headaches and mild dizziness around the time of these episodes but deny prolonged vomiting, failure to thrive, or regression of skills. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures now well controlled on medication, and a paternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. No known consanguinity is reported. Karen is currently attending school with age-appropriate academic performance between events."

Since early childhood, he has experienced progressive difficulty with coordination, characterized by an unsteady, wide-based gait and clumsiness with fine motor tasks such as handwriting and buttoning clothes. Teachers have reported that he frequently drops objects and has trouble participating in sports due to poor balance. Parents also describe intermittent tremulousness when reaching for items and a tendency to veer to one side when walking quickly. Metabolic history is notable for long-standing intolerance to dairy products, with abdominal cramping, bloating, and loose stools occurring within hours of milk or ice cream ingestion; symptoms improve with lactose-restricted diet and use of lactase supplements. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with “balance problems” beginning in mid-adulthood, requiring use of a cane, and a younger sister with similar, though milder, dairy-related gastrointestinal symptoms. No known consanguinity is reported. Timothy is otherwise in good health and takes no regular medications."

    "clinical_note": "Jessica Harris is a 3-year-old girl with a history notable for recurrent seizures beginning in early childhood, described as generalized convulsive episodes with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion. Events have occurred without clear provocation and have required emergency evaluation on several occasions. She is currently treated with antiseizure medication, with partial reduction in frequency but persistent breakthrough episodes. Development has been reported as otherwise appropriate for age. Clinical concerns also include a suspected inborn error of metabolism affecting aromatic amino acid handling, with prior episodes of irritability and decreased feeding during intercurrent illness, and biochemical studies suggesting an abnormality in tyrosine metabolism; confirmatory enzymatic and molecular workup is pending. There is a positive family history of seizure disorder in a maternal uncle, who developed epilepsy in adolescence and remains on long-term antiepileptic therapy. No known consanguinity is reported. Parents seek further clarification of the underlying etiology and guidance regarding prognosis and recurrence risk."

Since early childhood, caregivers have described delayed language acquisition and limited problem‑solving skills, though social engagement has generally been appropriate. Physical examination has consistently shown a pattern of distinctive craniofacial features suggestive of an underlying syndromic diagnosis, including subtle facial disproportion and minor skeletal anomalies. Clinical concerns also include a congenital cardiac defect involving the atrial septum, followed over time by cardiology, and the presence of multiple renal cysts detected on imaging, with ongoing nephrology surveillance but preserved kidney function to date. There is no known consanguinity or similarly affected relatives reported. Prior genetic evaluation included a single‑gene test performed on 2025-11-16, which was negative and did not establish a molecular diagnosis. Given the combination of congenital heart disease, cystic kidney changes, dysmorphic features, and moderate intellectual disability, a broader genomic study is being pursued to clarify the underlying etiology and guide management."

Clinical concerns also include long-standing gastrointestinal discomfort and dietary intolerance characterized by abdominal bloating, cramping, and loose stools occurring within hours of consuming dairy products, leading the family to largely restrict lactose-containing foods. Parents report occasional headaches and fatigue following these episodes but no clear developmental regression. Neurologic evaluation to date has not identified a structural brain lesion, and seizures have been variably responsive to standard antiseizure medication. There is no history of significant perinatal complications. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures that remitted in adolescence, and a paternal grandmother with chronic “milk intolerance” requiring dairy avoidance. No known consanguinity is reported. Michael lives with his parents and attends school with generally appropriate academic performance, though he has missed several days this year due to seizure events and gastrointestinal symptoms."

Examination has also described multiple congenital anomalies, including a recognized pattern of skeletal and craniofacial differences with mild facial dysmorphism, as well as a small, congenitally malformed kidney contributing to longstanding concerns regarding renal structure, though kidney function has remained clinically monitored. Overall appearance suggests an underlying syndromic etiology with multisystem involvement. Prior genetic testing included a targeted gene panel performed on 2025-05-30, which was reported as negative, without identification of a causative variant. He presents today for further etiologic clarification and ongoing management planning."

Since early childhood, he has demonstrated severe intellectual disability, with minimal functional academic skills and dependence on caregivers for most activities of daily living. History is notable for a repaired congenital cardiac septal defect in infancy, with no recent reports of cyanosis or heart failure symptoms. He was also born with an upper esophageal structural abnormality causing early feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and recurrent aspiration episodes, now partially mitigated by prior surgical intervention and modified diet. Physical examination over the years has described a pattern of dysmorphic features consistent with a recognizable congenital syndrome, including characteristic craniofacial proportions and mild skeletal anomalies. There is no known family history of similar neurodevelopmental or structural anomalies. Prior genetic evaluation included single-gene testing performed on 2025-01-21, which was reported as negative, and he is now referred for further genomic assessment to clarify the underlying etiology and assist with prognosis and family counseling."

Between episodes, she is generally well but has ongoing follow-up with metabolic specialists to monitor acid–base status and adjust nutritional support during periods of stress. Neurologically, clinical concerns include intermittent unsteadiness and poor coordination, particularly with tandem gait and fine motor tasks such as handwriting and buttoning clothes; teachers have reported clumsiness in gym class and difficulty with rapid alternating movements. There is no clear history of regression, seizures, or focal weakness, but mild truncal ataxia has been observed on examination. Family history is notable for a younger brother with episodic “stomach flu” and dehydration requiring IV fluids, and a maternal uncle described as “very clumsy” in childhood."

History is notable for recurrent episodes of altered responsiveness associated with generalized convulsive events, described by parents as sudden stiffening followed by rhythmic jerking of all extremities, with postictal sleepiness and confusion. Events have occurred without clear provocation, including during sleep and quiet wakefulness. Clinical concerns also include intermittent metabolic decompensation characterized by lethargy, tachypnea, and laboratory evidence of metabolic acidosis, occasionally requiring emergency department evaluation and intravenous fluids. Parents report decreased exercise tolerance during intercurrent illnesses, with poor oral intake and vomiting. Developmental progress has otherwise been appropriate for age. There is no history of significant head trauma or central nervous system infection. Family history is positive for a paternal uncle with childhood-onset seizures that resolved in adolescence, and a maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. No known consanguinity is reported. Thomas lives with both parents, attends kindergarten, and is not on any chronic antiseizure or metabolic medications at this time."

Parents also report intermittent concerns for poor energy and possible metabolic instability, including reduced exercise tolerance and prolonged recovery after minor illnesses, though growth has remained appropriate. Clinical course is further complicated by a prior superficial facial burn from accidental hot liquid exposure and a separate right ankle injury consistent with a sprain, both attributed to age-appropriate accidents without concern for non-accidental trauma. Medication history includes prior exposure to a penicillin-class antibiotic, after which she developed diffuse rash and vomiting, raising concern for a drug-related adverse reaction; this class is now avoided. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset seizure disorder requiring long-term antiseizure therapy, and a paternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Since infancy, he has shown features suggestive of a congenital patterning syndrome, including facial asymmetry and other subtle craniofacial differences, along with generalized hypotonia and poor coordination contributing to delayed independent walking. Clinical concerns include feeding difficulties related to a congenital narrowing in the upper esophagus, with intermittent choking and poor weight gain. Orthopedic evaluation documented congenital deformity of the feet with abnormal positioning at rest and on weight bearing. Examination is further notable for asymmetry of the external ears, with one ear smaller and more posteriorly rotated, raising concern for an underlying syndromic etiology. Past history also includes a prior superficial facial laceration involving the scalp and a thermal injury to the head region without reported loss of consciousness or lasting neurologic deficit. Prior genetic evaluation with single‑gene testing on 2025‑10‑03 was negative, and no definitive molecular diagnosis has yet been established."

History is notable for a recent closed head trauma without documented loss of consciousness. Caregivers report that immediately after the incident he cried promptly and has since remained interactive at his neurological baseline, with no witnessed seizures, persistent vomiting, or focal weakness. They do note some irritability and transient sleep disruption over the days following the event. Clinical concerns also include a superficial burn injury involving the head/face region sustained at the same time, reportedly from contact with a hot surface. The burn was initially managed with local wound care; there has been no evidence of infection, and dressings are being changed as instructed. On current review, parents deny visual changes, imbalance, or behavioral regression. No prior genetic testing has been performed. There is no known family history of neurological disorders, bleeding diathesis, or recurrent injuries, and no consanguinity is reported."

    "clinical_note": "Robert Sanchez is a 6-year-old boy with a history notable for recurrent generalized seizures beginning in early childhood, now characterized by episodes that are difficult to control despite standard antiepileptic therapy. Parents describe abrupt staring spells and convulsive events with postictal confusion and occasional incontinence, occurring several times per month, with no clear provoking factors. Clinical concerns also include persistently abnormal laboratory findings suggesting a possible underlying metabolic disturbance, with intermittently elevated serum markers under ongoing evaluation by his primary team. Developmental progress has been largely age appropriate per parental report. There is a positive family history of neurological disease, including a maternal uncle with childhood-onset epilepsy requiring long-term medication. The paternal side is notable for a grandfather with type 2 diabetes and a paternal aunt with autoimmune thyroid disease. No known consanguinity is reported. Robert lives with both parents and attends school with some accommodations during seizure-prone periods. He is referred today for further evaluation of his seizure disorder and possible metabolic contribution to his presentation."

Since early childhood, he has demonstrated significantly limited cognitive and adaptive functioning, requiring support with daily activities and specialized educational services. History is notable for congenital hydrocephalus identified in infancy, with progressive macrocephaly and need for ongoing neurosurgical and neurologic monitoring. Parents report longstanding feeding difficulties and choking episodes, and prior records describe a congenital narrowing at the junction of the throat and esophagus. Examination has consistently documented abnormal head and facial proportions with features suggestive of an underlying craniofacial syndrome and generalized body asymmetry. There is also a history of congenital spinal curvature contributing to postural imbalance. A prior single-gene test performed on 2025-11-13 was negative for the suspected condition at that time. Family history reveals a paternal grandfather with late-onset Parkinson’s disease and a maternal aunt with autoimmune thyroid disease; no known relatives with similar neurodevelopmental or structural brain abnormalities are reported."

Since infancy, parents have observed poor developmental progress and hypotonia, with delayed motor milestones; he began sitting independently well after the expected age and remains unsteady with ambulation. Facial features are described as mildly unusual, with a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, and subtle asymmetry, raising concern for an underlying congenital syndrome. Clinical concerns also include abnormalities of the external ears and periorbital region, with a history of congenital eyelid malposition and auricular malformation noted on prior examinations. There is no known consanguinity. Family history is notable for a paternal grandfather with late-onset Parkinson’s disease and a maternal aunt with autoimmune thyroid disease. Prior genetic evaluation included chromosomal microarray performed on 10/24/2025, which was reported as negative, and further genetic testing is now being pursued to clarify an underlying syndromic etiology."

    "clinical_note": "Jessica Adams is a 6-year-old girl with a history of recurrent generalized seizures beginning in early childhood, described as sudden loss of awareness with tonic-clonic activity and postictal confusion, occurring despite antiseizure therapy titration. Episodes have occasionally clustered, requiring emergency care. Parents also report intermittent staring spells suggestive of absence events, though these have been less clearly characterized. Clinical concerns further include gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and loose stools following ingestion of dairy products, leading the family to largely restrict milk and ice cream; symptoms improve with avoidance and use of lactose-free alternatives. Growth and overall development have been appropriate for age. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with childhood-onset epilepsy that persisted into adulthood, and a paternal cousin with “severe milk intolerance” requiring strict dietary modification. Additional history includes a maternal grandmother with rheumatoid arthritis and a father with early-onset hypertension. Prior genetic testing performed on 2022-05-18 reportedly showed no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and no clear etiology for the seizure disorder was identified."
