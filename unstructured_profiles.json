    "clinical_note": "Susan Green is an 8-year-old girl referred by Dr. Christopher Lee for further evaluation of behavioral and developmental concerns consistent with childhood disintegrative-type autism spectrum features. Parents report that Susan had an initial period of relatively typical early development, followed by a notable regression beginning in early childhood, with loss of previously acquired language and social skills. Current concerns include markedly reduced social interaction, limited eye contact, and diminished interest in peer relationships. She exhibits repetitive behaviors, rigid routines, and significant difficulty with transitions. Teachers and parents describe unusual and disruptive behaviors, including episodes of agitation, self-directed vocalizations without clear communicative intent, and atypical responses to sensory stimuli (e.g., covering ears in response to ordinary sounds, distress with changes in clothing textures). There are also concerns about variable attention and occasional unexplained behavioral outbursts that are not clearly triggered by environmental factors. No prior genetic or metabolic testing has been documented. Family history is notable for a maternal cousin diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition in early childhood, with ongoing social communication difficulties and special education needs. In addition, a paternal grandfather reportedly had late-onset Alzheimer-type dementia, and a maternal aunt has long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. There is no known history of consanguinity. No other significant hereditary neurological or developmental disorders have been reported in the family."

Developmentally, Matthew has a history of significant delays across multiple domains; he walked and talked later than expected and currently demonstrates moderate limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive skills, requiring special education services and support with activities of daily living consistent with a moderate degree of cognitive impairment. Neurologically, he has a diagnosis of focal epilepsy with impairment of consciousness and intractable seizures, with episodes characterized by focal onset progressing to bilateral tonic-clonic activity and prolonged postictal confusion, despite treatment with multiple antiseizure medications. No significant family history is reported, and there is no known parental consanguinity.

Developmentally, he demonstrates significant delays across multiple domains, with late attainment of gross motor milestones (e.g., delayed independent walking), fine motor incoordination, and expressive and receptive language delays, along with ongoing concerns for impaired adaptive functioning at home and in school settings. Neurologically, he has a history of recurrent unprovoked seizures without a clearly identified etiology, with events described as generalized convulsive episodes associated with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion; seizure control has been variable despite standard antiseizure management. In addition, there are broader neurodevelopmental concerns, including difficulties with social communication, atypical play, and behavioral dysregulation that have not been fully characterized but raise concern for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.

    "clinical_note": "George Taylor is a 13-year-old patient referred by Dr. Karen White for further evaluation of a complex clinical presentation that includes multiple structural anomalies, developmental concerns, and neurologic findings. Since early childhood, caregivers have reported the presence of several congenital anomalies involving more than one organ system, though no unifying diagnosis has been established to date. In addition, George has a history of mild intellectual impairment with global delays in achieving developmental milestones, including later-than-expected acquisition of expressive language and academic skills; current school performance is below grade level, and he receives special education services and speech/occupational therapy. Neurologically, he exhibits a progressive gait disturbance characterized by imbalance and clumsiness, with difficulty running and frequent falls, suggestive of a spinocerebellar ataxia pattern; there are no clear focal motor deficits, but coordination is notably impaired on tandem walking and finger-to-nose testing. Prior genetic evaluation has included a single-gene analysis performed on 02/22/2025, which was reported as negative and did not identify a causative variant to explain the observed congenital anomalies, developmental delay, or ataxic features. No significant family history is reported, and there is no known parental consanguinity."

Parents report limited eye contact, difficulty initiating and sustaining peer relationships, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities (particularly to loud sounds and certain clothing textures). There is a history of atypical play patterns, insistence on routines, and significant distress with changes in schedule. School reports describe challenges with reciprocal conversation, understanding social cues, and group work, as well as occasional behavioral outbursts when routines are disrupted. She has required school-based supports, including an individualized education plan focused on social skills and classroom accommodations. Feeding difficulties have been noted since toddler years, characterized by strong food selectivity based on texture and color and prolonged mealtimes; although her growth parameters are currently appropriate, her dietary variety remains limited and her parents report ongoing concern about her restrictive eating patterns. Family history is notable for a younger brother diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder with similar social-communication difficulties and restricted interests, as well as a maternal uncle who was described as “socially awkward” with learning challenges and who required special education services during childhood, though no formal diagnosis was documented. Parents report that they are second cousins, and there is awareness of distant relatives with developmental and behavioral concerns on both sides of the family. No prior genetic or metabolic testing has been documented in the record."

According to caregiver and school reports, James has had persistent qualitative impairments in social reciprocity, including limited eye contact, difficulty understanding social cues, and challenges in forming and maintaining peer relationships, as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. There is a history of behavioral rigidity, sensory sensitivities, and episodes of marked inattention and poor concentration documented in the educational setting, with teachers reporting fluctuating alertness and difficulty sustaining focus during academic tasks. These cognitive and attentional concerns have contributed to academic underperformance and the need for individualized educational supports. Family history is notable for a younger brother diagnosed in early childhood with a similar autism spectrum presentation characterized by social communication difficulties and restricted interests, and a maternal male cousin with learning difficulties requiring special education services, though no formal diagnostic workup is known for the cousin. The parents report that they are second cousins, and there are no known pregnancies affected by recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, or early neonatal death.

Developmentally, he has exhibited significant delays since early childhood, with late attainment of major motor and language milestones and persistent global delay in adaptive, social, and academic functioning. School reports and prior developmental evaluations describe ongoing difficulties with expressive and receptive language, fine and gross motor coordination, and learning, requiring individualized educational support and related therapies. Neurologically, he has experienced intermittent abnormal movements and tone abnormalities consistent with a childhood-onset movement disorder, including episodes of increased tone and dystonic posturing, as well as periods of hypotonia in infancy, raising concern for an underlying central motor pathway disturbance. There is no reported history of similar neurodevelopmental or structural brain conditions in first- or second-degree relatives, and no known consanguinity; overall, no significant contributory family history has been reported.

He has a documented malformation of cortical development involving the cerebral hemispheres, noted on prior neuroimaging as abnormal cortical organization consistent with a congenital brain anomaly. Developmentally, he has longstanding cognitive delays with overall functioning in the mild intellectual disability range, requiring academic support services and assistance with activities that demand higher-level reasoning and adaptive skills. Neurologically, he has a history of recurrent seizure episodes without a clearly identified precipitating cause; events have been described as generalized convulsive episodes with postictal confusion, and he is followed by neurology for ongoing management. No additional systemic or metabolic abnormalities have been reported to date. Family history is noncontributory, with no known relatives affected by similar neurodevelopmental, neurological, or congenital conditions, and no known consanguinity. Prior genetic evaluation has included chromosomal microarray performed on 2025-09-01, which was reported as negative for pathogenic copy number changes."

Congenital renal malformation consistent with unilateral renal agenesis has been documented, with absence of one kidney on prior imaging and associated reduced overall renal mass, though without current need for renal replacement therapy; blood pressure and basic renal function have been monitored periodically. Developmental history is notable for significant delays in multiple domains, with functioning in the moderate intellectual disability range, including marked delays in expressive language, need for assistance with activities of daily living beyond what is expected for age, and requirement for individualized educational support services through school. Neurological examination and history are significant for abnormal involuntary movements characterized by intermittent dystonic posturing and abnormal muscle contractions affecting gait and fine motor control; these episodes are not clearly triggered by medications or metabolic derangements and have prompted ongoing neurologic follow-up. No additional systemic or metabolic abnormalities have been identified to date. Family history is reported as noncontributory, with no known similarly affected relatives and no known consanguinity between the parents. Prior genetic evaluation has included chromosomal microarray performed on 2024-12-31, which was reported as negative for pathogenic copy number changes."

Behavioral observations have included episodes of unusual or socially inappropriate behaviors and emotional responses not proportionate to the situation, with occasional agitation and difficulty with transitions, leading to concerns about broader behavioral dysregulation. The patient also reports intermittent shortness of breath, described as brief episodes of feeling unable to take a full breath, occurring both at rest and with exertion, without clear precipitating factors or associated chest pain; no prior cardiopulmonary workup is documented in the chart. In addition, he has a history of recurrent headaches, typically bifrontal, of moderate intensity, occurring several times per week, sometimes associated with light sensitivity and difficulty concentrating, but without associated focal neurological deficits, visual changes, or recent head trauma. Family history is notable for a younger brother diagnosed in childhood with an autism spectrum condition and ongoing social-communication difficulties, and a paternal cousin reported to have significant learning and behavioral challenges requiring special education services, though no specific diagnosis is known; there is no known consanguinity. No prior genetic or metabolic testing is documented in the available records."

There is no associated syncope reported, but the discomfort has been concerning enough to limit his usual play activities on occasion. In addition, the caregiver reports episodes of shortness of breath, particularly with physical activity such as running or climbing stairs, during which William appears winded sooner than peers and needs to rest to catch his breath; these episodes are not accompanied by audible wheezing at home, and there is no history of nocturnal awakenings due to breathing difficulty. He has also had recurrent headaches over the past several months, described as frontal or generalized in location, occurring several times per week, sometimes associated with irritability and a preference for a dark, quiet room. The headaches are variably responsive to over-the-counter analgesics, and there is no history of visual changes, focal weakness, or seizure-like activity reported. No prior diagnostic testing or imaging related to these symptoms is documented in the chart, and no previous genetic or metabolic evaluations are noted. Family history is reviewed and is not contributory; no significant family history is reported, and there is no known parental consanguinity."

Parents report longstanding social communication difficulties, including limited eye contact, reduced reciprocal conversation, and challenges engaging in age-appropriate peer interactions. He exhibits restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, such as intense preoccupation with specific topics and a strong need for routines, with significant distress when these are disrupted. Behavioral concerns include impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, and challenges with self-regulation that have affected his functioning at home and in school. There is a history of delayed acquisition of social and adaptive skills, and teachers have noted problems with classroom participation and following multi-step instructions. No prior genetic or metabolic testing results are available in the record. Family history is notable for a maternal younger brother diagnosed in early childhood with autism spectrum–type developmental and social communication difficulties requiring special education services. A paternal first cousin reportedly has significant learning difficulties and behavioral concerns consistent with attention and concentration problems, currently managed with school-based supports. Parents report that Michael’s parents are second cousins, with shared grandparents on one side of the family. Additional family history includes a maternal grandmother with long-standing osteoarthritis requiring joint replacement in her 60s and a paternal uncle with seasonal allergic rhinitis; these relatives are otherwise healthy. No other significant hereditary conditions have been documented."
