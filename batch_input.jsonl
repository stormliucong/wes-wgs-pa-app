If it is absent, do not mention age.\n    7) Language: Avoid lists, headings, or formulaic expressions when making clinical descriptions (e.g., “The patient presents with…”). Use natural \n    clinical phrasing such as “History is notable for…,” “Since early childhood…,” or “Clinical concerns include…”. Use concrete descriptions and avoid \n    non-informative or defensive phrasing such as “no documented evidence of…” and “otherwise unremarkable” unless uncertainty is clinically meaningful. \n    Clearly describe symptom type, pattern, and functional impact (e.g., frequency, severity, triggers, effect on school or daily activities). Avoid \n    generic terms like “issues”, “concerns” or “abnormalities” without qualification.\n    8) Format: Generate one paragraph of at least 160 words and no more than 200 words for the primary clinical description (including symtoms/phenotypes \n    and family history/prior test). If the sample type is 3a where secondary_icd_codes list also provided, generate a separate paragraph indicated as secondary \n    medical issues or histories of no more than 100 words.

Use concrete descriptions and avoid \n    non-informative or defensive phrasing such as “no documented evidence of…” and “otherwise unremarkable” unless uncertainty is clinically meaningful. \n    Clearly describe symptom type, pattern, and functional impact (e.g., frequency, severity, triggers, effect on school or daily activities). Avoid \n    generic terms like “issues”, “concerns” or “abnormalities” without qualification.\n    8) Format: Generate one paragraph of at least 160 words and no more than 200 words for the primary clinical description (including symtoms/phenotypes \n    and family history/prior test).

Do NOT state the ICD codes explicitly in the note. \n    2) If the metabolic flag is true, describe with clinically interpretable results, such as the named analyte, direction \n    and magnitude of abnormality, and whether the finding is persistent or episodic (for example, chronically elevated phenylalanine \n    levels with dietary sensitivity).

Do not use vague or placeholder \n    language such as “abnormal labs,” “blood chemistry findings,” or nonspecific “laboratory abnormalities.” \n    3) If the dysmorphic flag is true, explain with 1~2 concrete descriptors rather than a broad statement.\n    4) Family history: If family_history is true, generate records for affected relatives and/or consanguinity with details.

If it is absent, do not mention age.\n    7) Language: Avoid lists, headings, or formulaic expressions when making clinical descriptions (e.g., “The patient presents with…”). Use natural \n    clinical phrasing such as “History is notable for…,” “Since early childhood…,” or “Clinical concerns include…”. Use concrete descriptions and avoid \n    non-informative or defensive phrasing such as “no documented evidence of…” and “otherwise unremarkable” unless uncertainty is clinically meaningful. \n    Clearly describe symptom type, pattern, and functional impact (e.g., frequency, severity, triggers, effect on school or daily activities). Avoid \n    generic terms like “issues”, “concerns” or “abnormalities” without qualification.\n    8) Format: Generate one paragraph of at least 160 words and no more than 200 words for the primary clinical description (including symtoms/phenotypes \n    and family history/prior test). If the sample type is 3a where secondary_icd_codes list also provided, generate a separate paragraph indicated as secondary \n    medical issues or histories of no more than 100 words. The note should read like a real specialist clinical document, suitable for chart review.\n    9) Realism: Do not make extra interpretation or imply any causations between co-existing conditions.

Do NOT state the ICD codes explicitly in the note. \n    2) If the metabolic flag is true, describe with clinically interpretable results, such as the named analyte, direction \n    and magnitude of abnormality, and whether the finding is persistent or episodic (for example, chronically elevated phenylalanine \n    levels with dietary sensitivity).

Do not use vague or placeholder \n    language such as “abnormal labs,” “blood chemistry findings,” or nonspecific “laboratory abnormalities.” \n    3) If the dysmorphic flag is true, explain with 1~2 concrete descriptors rather than a broad statement.\n    4) Family history: If family_history is true, generate records for affected relatives and/or consanguinity with details.

If it is absent, do not mention age.\n    7) Language: Avoid lists, headings, or formulaic expressions when making clinical descriptions (e.g., “The patient presents with…”). Use natural \n    clinical phrasing such as “History is notable for…,” “Since early childhood…,” or “Clinical concerns include…”. Use concrete descriptions and avoid \n    non-informative or defensive phrasing such as “no documented evidence of…” and “otherwise unremarkable” unless uncertainty is clinically meaningful. \n    Clearly describe symptom type, pattern, and functional impact (e.g., frequency, severity, triggers, effect on school or daily activities). Avoid \n    generic terms like “issues”, “concerns” or “abnormalities” without qualification.\n    8) Format: Generate one paragraph of at least 160 words and no more than 200 words for the primary clinical description (including symtoms/phenotypes \n    and family history/prior test). If the sample type is 3a where secondary_icd_codes list also provided, generate a separate paragraph indicated as secondary \n    medical issues or histories of no more than 100 words. The note should read like a real specialist clinical document, suitable for chart review.\n    9) Realism: Do not make extra interpretation or imply any causations between co-existing conditions.

If it is absent, do not mention age.\n    7) Language: Avoid lists, headings, or formulaic expressions when making clinical descriptions (e.g., “The patient presents with…”). Use natural \n    clinical phrasing such as “History is notable for…,” “Since early childhood…,” or “Clinical concerns include…”. Use concrete descriptions and avoid \n    non-informative or defensive phrasing such as “no documented evidence of…” and “otherwise unremarkable” unless uncertainty is clinically meaningful. \n    Clearly describe symptom type, pattern, and functional impact (e.g., frequency, severity, triggers, effect on school or daily activities). Avoid \n    generic terms like “issues”, “concerns” or “abnormalities” without qualification.\n    8) Format: Generate one paragraph of at least 160 words and no more than 200 words for the primary clinical description (including symtoms/phenotypes \n    and family history/prior test). If the sample type is 3a where secondary_icd_codes list also provided, generate a separate paragraph indicated as secondary \n    medical issues or histories of no more than 100 words. The note should read like a real specialist clinical document, suitable for chart review.\n    9) Realism: Do not make extra interpretation or imply any causations between co-existing conditions.
