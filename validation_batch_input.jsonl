Since infancy, he has demonstrated global developmental delay with persistent limitations in both cognitive and adaptive functioning; academic skills remain significantly below age expectations, and he requires ongoing special education services and support for daily living activities. Early neuroimaging reportedly showed underdevelopment of the cerebral hemispheres consistent with a structural brain malformation, which has been correlated with his delays and learning difficulties. Physical examination has previously documented a characteristic pattern of facial differences and disproportion suggestive of an underlying congenital syndromic etiology. Clinical concerns include slow linear growth and failure to reach anticipated developmental milestones despite appropriate nutritional support and therapies.

Parents report several emergency visits over the past two years for lethargy, tachypnea, and poor oral intake, during which laboratory studies repeatedly demonstrated metabolic acidosis requiring IV fluids and careful electrolyte management. Since the neonatal period, he was noted to have generalized hypotonia, with a “floppy” appearance and delayed attainment of early motor milestones; he sat independently later than expected and required physical therapy to support gross motor development. More recently, he continues to fatigue easily with physical activity, though there is no clear history of seizures or focal neurologic deficits. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with “low muscle tone” in childhood that improved over time, and a paternal cousin who reportedly had unexplained acidosis during a severe viral illness.

Seizure frequency has fluctuated, with several breakthrough events reported over the past year, some occurring without clear triggers. Parents also report intermittent postictal confusion and fatigue, but no persistent focal neurological deficits have been documented between episodes. In addition, clinical concerns include gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and loose stools after ingestion of milk and other dairy products, leading the family to largely restrict lactose-containing foods; symptoms improve when dairy is avoided. Growth has been appropriate, but there is parental worry regarding dietary limitations and potential nutritional compromise.

Since infancy, she has had intermittent episodes concerning for seizures, described as brief unresponsiveness with generalized shaking and postictal fatigue; these events continue sporadically despite normal basic labs and imaging. Clinical concerns also include a chronic, unexplained metabolic disorder characterized by episodic fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, and intermittent vomiting, with prior evaluations suggesting an inborn error of metabolism without a specific diagnosis. Examination over time has noted mild dysmorphic facial features and subtle distal limb anomalies, in the setting of otherwise normal growth parameters. She has experienced multiple hospitalizations for metabolic decompensation during intercurrent illnesses.

History is notable for intermittent generalized weakness and poor coordination during periods of intercurrent illness, with parents describing episodes of “floppiness” and delayed motor responses when she is unwell. Past records document recurrent metabolic acidosis requiring emergency department visits, during which she experiences lethargy, slowed movements, and difficulty maintaining posture. Between episodes, she returns close to baseline but reports easy fatigability with prolonged activity and occasional fine tremor of the hands. There is no history of seizures, but she describes transient muscle stiffness and cramping, particularly in the lower extremities, that can limit ambulation on bad days. Birth and early developmental history were reportedly unremarkable.

Parents report intermittent vomiting, poor appetite during intercurrent infections, and occasional irritability and headaches, with improvement on a protein-restricted diet. Developmental milestones have been largely age-appropriate, but teachers have observed fluctuating attention and occasional difficulty with concentration on days following illness. Clinical concerns also include early-life neuromotor irritability; as an infant she demonstrated increased startle, jitteriness, and intermittent hypertonia, which gradually improved over the first year but left a tendency toward mild clumsiness and fatigue with prolonged activity. There is a family history of a maternal uncle with “seizures” of unclear etiology beginning in childhood and a paternal cousin with learning difficulties requiring special education services.

History is notable for multiple unprovoked seizure episodes beginning in mid-adolescence, described as generalized convulsive events with postictal confusion and no consistent precipitating factors. He has required several emergency department visits for these episodes, during which laboratory studies repeatedly demonstrated significant derangements in acid–base balance with low serum bicarbonate and elevated anion gap, consistent with episodes of metabolic acidosis. Between acute events, he reports intermittent fatigue and headaches but is generally able to attend school, though he has missed classes due to hospitalizations. There is no known exposure to toxins or medications that would clearly account for these findings.

Since early childhood, they have observed subtle facial differences, including a broad nasal bridge and mildly downslanting palpebral fissures, along with a somewhat asymmetric facial appearance, prompting concern for an underlying syndromic diagnosis. She has also been followed for multiple congenital anomalies, including mild limb asymmetry and joint laxity, which contribute to clumsiness and frequent falls. Clinical concerns recently escalated after an episode in which she twisted her right ankle during play, leading to significant swelling and pain consistent with a moderate right ankle sprain; imaging excluded fracture. Several months earlier, she sustained a mild head injury without loss of consciousness after a fall from standing height, with transient headache but no persistent neurologic deficits.
